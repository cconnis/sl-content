==== Overview

Segments are dynamic groupings of Contacts that can be used to target
content based on Contacts' profile information, preferences, and
behavior, which can be used as inclusion or exclusion logic when
building audiences for Campaigns! Segments process every time a Campaign
is sent to ensure you're using the most up to date information available
to target your marketing content.

Read on to learn about advanced techniques for Segmenting your audience!

[[activity]]
=== Engagement Activity

Engaged Contacts and unengaged Contacts need different types of
outreach, and Segments are a great way to keep up with your audience's
engagement patterns.

See the
https://help.sendlane.com/article/452-segment-options-and-operators#engagement-activity[Engagement
& Activity section of Segment Options and Operators] for detailed
descriptions of each available option.

==== Engaged Contacts

A Segment of recently engaged Contacts is vital to your sending cadence
and is your first line of defense if you start to experience
deliverability hiccups. Engaged Contacts are more likely to open and
click your emails which shows inbox providers that your audience is
healthy and engaged.

This Segment will pull Contacts who clicked a link in an email or SMS
Campaign, OR opened an email Campaign, OR subscribed to your audience in
the past X days. Most merchants will do well with the following Segments
at 30, 60, and 90 day intervals. If your business runs more seasonally,
adjust the timeframe as needed.

. Clicked > Recent > X > Days, OR
. Opened > Recent > X > Days, OR
. Subscription Date > in the last > X > Days

To target your most engaged Contacts,

==== Unengaged Contacts

A Segment of unengaged Contacts can be used as an exclusion for
Campaigns during a deliverability hiccup, or part of a
https://help.sendlane.com/article/215-how-to-remove-unengaged-contacts-with-segmentation[careful
re-engagement strategy]. Unengaged Contacts are less likely to open or
click your emails which can be detrimental to your sending reputation.

This Segment will pull Contacts who have not opened an email or clicked
a link in an email or SMS in the past X days and have not subscribed to
your audience in the past X days. Adjust the timeframe as needed for
your business.

. Did Not Open > Recent > X > Days, OR
. Did Not Click > Recent > X > Days, AND
. Subscription Date > not in the last > X > Days

[[purchase]]
=== Purchase Activity

Contacts' purchase data is segmented by your eCommerce integration.
Contacts who have made purchases (purchasers) may benefit from content
inviting them to try new products or giving them information on how to
use your products, while Contacts who have never purchased
(non-purchasers) may benefit from content that includes special
promotions or other incentives to make a purchase.

===== Purchasers - All Time

This Segment pulls all Contacts who have ever completed an order in your
eCommerce store.

. Store > order > Fulfilled (or the order status your store uses to
indicate a completed order) > Exists
