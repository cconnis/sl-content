===== üö¶ Before Getting Started

Prior to creating a segment, you need to have

that contains Contact attribute data. Attribute data includes a
Contact's profile properties, engagement history, purchase history, and
more. Check out the complete list of available

[[logic]]
=== Understanding Segment Logic

Check out the¬†
https://help.sendlane.com/article/452-segment-options-and-operators[Segment
Options and Operators] guide for a complete overview of all Segment
logic.

Use multiple options by including OR/AND conditions in your Segment:

* OR condition ‚Äì Adds Contacts to Segment if they meet *any* of the
logic‚Äôs condition.
* AND condition ‚Äì Adds Contacts to Segment if they meet *all* of the
logic‚Äôs conditions

[[sizing]]
===== ‚ö†Ô∏è More conditions result in smaller Segments, fewer conditions result in larger Segments

Segments are essentially a way to filter your Contacts based on
attributes or behaviors you select as conditions. More conditions lead
to more filtering, which results in a smaller pool of Contacts because
conditions are more specific. Fewer conditions lead to less filtering,
which results in a larger pool of Contacts because conditions are more
broad.

[[invert]]
=== Inverting Segment Logic

Each Segment condition can be inverted by selecting the *Inverse of this
condition* checkbox. When this checkbox is selected, Contacts who _do
not_ meet the condition will be pulled into the Segment.

=== Troubleshooting

====== My Segment is showing 0 Contacts!¬†

If a segment you've recently created is showing zero contacts, check the
conditions you have in place. If you have multiple conditions, double
check your AND/OR logic. If you have AND selected, both conditions must
be met in order for a contact to appear within the segment. If OR is
selected, meeting just one of the conditions will place a contact within
the segment.¬†
