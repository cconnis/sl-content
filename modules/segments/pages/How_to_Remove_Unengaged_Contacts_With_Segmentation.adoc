  https://help.sendlane.com/article/452-segment-options-and-operators[segment's
  parameters] to
  `+Did Not Open - Any Email Campaign AND Subscription Date is before [date]+`.
  This Segment will pull all Contacts who subscribed before the date you
  selected and have not opened any email Campaigns. We recommend
  selecting a date at least 30 days in the past to give new subscribers
  a chance to engage with your emails.

  ====== Please Note

  If you created this segment for one specific list, the contacts will
  be removed _only_Â from that list, even if they are on other lists
  within your account.Â  +
   +
  If you created a global segment, the contacts will be deleted
  permanently from your _entire_ account.
  . Once the contacts have been removed, a .CSV file will be emailed to
  the address linked to your Sendlane account for your records. +
  +
  ====== Please Note

  Files of deleted contacts under 20k rows will download immediately,
  anything larger will be sent via email.

  Depending on the number of contacts you're deleting, the file may not
  arrive immediately. Please allow time for larger files to process and
  be delivered to your inbox!
