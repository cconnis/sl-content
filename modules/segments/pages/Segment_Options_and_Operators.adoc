[[location-segmentation]]
===== ⚠️ Use caution when selecting location based Segment options

Segmenting by location depends heavily on your business operations. Make
sure to read the descriptions of each location option carefully. If you
ship products, your best bet is to use a line from your customers'
shipping locations using your eCommerce integration's Segmentation
options instead of the address data in the Contact Properties section.
