Many inbox providers useÂ Sender Policy Framework (SPF)Â records
toÂ determine the legitimacyÂ of an email address and detect domain
spoofing. To ensure that your emails maintain optimal deliverability, we
recommend authenticating your domain with an SPF record!

[[single-record]]
===== ðŸš¨ Important Note

Make sure to add only one SPF record to your domain. Multiple SPF
records can cause serious delivery issues because inbox providers will
not be able to tell which authentication is real.

=== Setting up Your SPF Record

Every domain provider has specific instructions on adding SPF records
within their platform. Search your domain provider's knowledge base to
find step by step instructions!

Below are generalized instructions for adding an SPF record to your
domain:

. Navigate to your Domain Provider
. Locate the DNS editor/zone
. Add a record containing the following:Â *v=spf1 mx
include:_spf.sendlane.com ~all*
. ****If prompted use the â€˜@â€™ symbol for the host field
. Make sure to save your changes

=== *Troubleshooting*

Because SPF/DNS record setup done within your domain provider, Sendlane
can provide limited technical support. Reach out to your DNS hosting
company's support for more assistance.

[[deliverability]]
====== Deliverability didn't improve after I added an SPF record!

SPF record validationÂ can help establish your sender reputation if
you're just starting out, or protect performance that's already strong.
If your sender reputation is poor, SPF authentication is unlikely to
improve your reputation or boost your delivery.

[[cloudflare]]
====== I use Cloudflare for hosting and can't add SPF records!

Use Cloudflare's guidance for adding TXT records. For more information,
