Warming up a new sending infrastructure is a complex project with many
moving parts. If you‚Äôve gone through Sendlane‚Äôs white glove onboarding,
you‚Äôll be familiar with the strategic decisions made for every part of
the process: content, timing, and, most important, audience
segmentation. Segmentation is absolutely crucial during warm up because
warm up is the period in which you make or break your
https://www.socketlabs.com/blog/teach-me-email-what-is-sender-reputation/[sending
reputation]. But the end of warm up doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs time to relax on
segmenting your audience before sending; in fact, you can undo all the
hard work of warming up your sending reputation with just a few
insufficiently targeted sends.

Maintaining your sending reputation is a marathon, not a sprint. It‚Äôs
something that has to be monitored and adjusted over the entire life of
your business. There is never a point at which you can say, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve made
it; we can send whatever we want, whenever we want‚Äù without running the
risk of burning your domain.

In this guide, we‚Äôll discuss why you should always use segmentation to
target your sends, and never send to your entire list at once. We‚Äôll
also provide guidance for creating Segments that make targeting your
sends nearly as easy as sending to your full list!

If you're new to email marketing in general or just new to Sendlane,
welcome! Please read the

warm your sending infrastructure. Warming is absolutely critical to
developing a good sending reputation!

=== Why You Should Never Send to Your Full List

Sending to your entire list can negatively affect your sending
reputation, which in turn negatively affects your entire business. Here
are the most important factors to consider before sending to your full
list:

* *Spam traps.* There are
https://www.spamhaus.com/resource-center/spamtraps-fix-the-problem-not-the-symptom/[many
different types] of inactive or ‚Äúfaked‚Äù email addresses that inbox
providers use as traps to catch marketing emails that are sent without
consent. When an inbox provider knows that an email address is not used
by an actual person, it expects the email address to not receive
marketing email since no one has consented to receive it. When you send
to spam traps, you‚Äôre telling the inbox provider that you don‚Äôt collect
consent from the people you send to. Sending to spam traps is incredibly
easy to do when sending to your full list because you aren‚Äôt using any
indicators of engagement to determine whether the people you‚Äôre sending
to want to receive your emails.
* *Email addresses get deactivated.* Even without being turned into an
official spam trap, old and inactive emails are more likely to
https://help.sendlane.com/article/355-bounced-emails#hard[hard bounce].
Hard bounces can negatively affect your sending reputation if you
accumulate too many, and sending to your entire list at one time is the
easiest way to amass a lot of hard bounces quickly.
* *Interests change over time.* People who haven't opened or clicked on
your marketing emails in months or years aren‚Äôt very likely to start
engaging again. While it‚Äôs valuable to keep older Contacts in your
audience to maintain historical data, it‚Äôs important to recognize that
any number of reasons can cause people to lose interest in your content
and many of them are completely outside of your control, including
simple changes in interests. When people receive emails they aren‚Äôt
interested in, they are more likely to report your email as spam, which
damages your sending reputation.
* *Unspecific content may inspire unsubscribes.* People want to engage
in content that feels like it was created just for them. When you send
to your full list, you‚Äôre sending the most generic content possible to
try and appeal to as many of your Contacts as possible. Generic content
can lead Contacts to unsubscribe because it doesn‚Äôt seem useful or
relevant.
* *It costs you money!* Sendlane is a sending based platform, meaning
you pay for the emails you send, not the Contacts you store in your
account. Sending to your entire list at once uses up the valuable
sending credits you pay for and all but certainly harms your sending
reputation. Sending to your whole list just isn‚Äôt worth it.

[[useful-segments]]
=== Useful Segments to Target Sends for Every Marketing Strategy

Now that we‚Äôve established why sending to your full list is not the best
use of your sending infrastructure let‚Äôs go over what you can do
instead! The Segments below can be useful to any eCommerce business to
target Campaigns and increase engagement.

[[time]]
==== Time Based Engagement Segments

Once you‚Äôve reached 30 days of sending, create a Segment for Contacts
who have clicked in the last 30 days plus Contacts who subscribed to
your marketing program within the last 30 days.

To build a Segment for 30 day active Contacts:

. https://help.sendlane.com/article/137-segments#creating-segment[Create
a new Segment] and name it 30 Day Actives
. Click the *Engagement & Activity tab*
. Select *Clicked*
. Select *Recent*
. Enter *30*
. Select *Days*
. Click *+ or condition*
. Click the *Contact Properties tab*
. Select *Subscription Date*
. Select *in the last*
. Enter *30*
. Select *Days*
. Click *Save*

Your Segment will take a few seconds or minutes to process, depending on
the size of your overall audience.

Repeat the steps above for two additional segments: one for 60 Day
Actives and one for 90 Day Actives. These three Segments make up your
trifecta of positively engaged Contacts and represent the portion of
your audience that is currently engaging with your content. Your
positive engagement Segments should look like this, with the number of
days set to 30, 60, and 90, respectively:

Contacts who haven‚Äôt been engaging with your content need their own
Segments too! The following Segment of Contacts who have not clicked in
the last 90 days and signed up for your emails more than 90 days ago can
be used as an exclusion list or later re-targeting (though we generally
recommend against re-targeting in favor of focusing more resources on
those Contacts who are engaged).

https://help.sendlane.com/article/137-segments#creating-segment[Create a
new Segment] and name it 90 Day Inactives, then:

. Click the *Engagement & Activity tab*
. Select *Did Not Click*
. Select *Recent*
. Enter *90*
. Select *Days*
. Click *+ and condition*
. Click the *Contact Properties tab*
. Select *Subscription Date*
. Select *not in the last*
. Enter *90*
. Select *Days*
. Click *Save*

Your Segment will take a few seconds or minutes to process, depending on
the size of your overall audience, and should look like this:

[[purchase]]
==== Purchase Activity Based Segments

‚ÄúPurchasers‚Äù and ‚Äúnon-purchasers‚Äù are great segments of Contacts to have
ready to go for sales, product announcements, and other special offers.

Purchasers should receive content inviting them to try a different
product, and non-purchasers should receive content inviting them to try
your brand for the first time. Check out Sendlane‚Äôs many guides to
https://www.sendlane.com/blog-category/email-marketing[email] and
https://www.sendlane.com/blog-category/sms-mms-marketing[SMS] marketing
content for tips on creating effective content for these two important
segments of your audience.

Because Sendlane allows you to exclude Segments as well as include
Segments when building your Campaign audience, you only need to build
one Segment to target both purchasers and non-purchasers: you‚Äôll build
one Segment for purchasers and exclude that Segment when you want to
send to non-purchasers!

To build a Segment that will pull everyone who has ever made a purchase:

. https://help.sendlane.com/article/137-segments#creating-segment[Create
a new Segment] and name it *All Time Purchasers*
. Click your *eCommerce platform‚Äôs tab*
. Select your *store*
. Select *order*
. Select the *order status* you use to indicate that orders are complete
(usually ‚ÄúFulfilled‚Äù)
. Select *Exists*
. Click *Save*

This Segment will dynamically pull any Contact who makes a purchase in
your eCommerce store and accepts marketing content.¬†You can narrow this
Segment down by order date, products purchased, and
https://help.sendlane.com/article/452-segment-options-and-operators[so
much more] to create even more targeted Segments.
