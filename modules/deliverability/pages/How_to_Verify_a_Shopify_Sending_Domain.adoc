from your brand, without qualifiers such as "via Sendlane" appearing in
Contacts' inboxes. Read on to learn how to verify a sending domain and
authenticate a Sender Profile!#

* Have admin access to your Shopify account. Sendlane cannot adjust your
DNS settings.

* Read

* If you have

verifying with Sendlane. If the same subdomain is used for both, then
both channels can be interrupted by one channel's deliverability hiccup,

  [.c0]#Before starting the process of creating a subdomain, you'll need
  to decide what you want your subdomain to be and ensure it is not
  already being used.#

  [.c0]#Choose a common subdomain like send, mail, or e, or choose a
  word related to your business. Do not choose a subdomain that could
  cause inbox providers or Contacts to confuse you with another
  business. Using another business' name (including Sendlane) will cause
  deliverability issues.#

  .. Before continuing with the next send, pause to review reporting
  from the previous sends. Pay close attention to the Email Providers &
  Devices section of your Campaign report to confirm that emails are
  being accepted appropriately. Gmail, Yahoo, and AOL should show 15-20%
  open rates.
