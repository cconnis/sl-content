==== Overview

A verified sending domain is a subdomain of your business‚Äôs primary
domain used exclusively for sending marketing content. Using a subdomain
to send marketing content protects your primary domain so that your
marketing channel does not negatively affect your primary domain‚Äôs email
delivery, which you rely on for daily internal and external business
communication.

In accordance with Google and Yahoo's 2024 announcements, Sendlane will
require all users to send exclusively from verified sending domains,
using authenticated sender profiles. An¬†authenticated sender
profile¬†uses a¬†verified sending domain¬†as the email domain of its ‚Äúsent
from‚Äù and ‚Äúreply to‚Äù email addresses.¬† +

Sendlane‚Äôs preferred technique for verifying a sending domain is called
subdomain DNS delegation using just a few records in your DNS setup.
This technique provides SPF, DKIM, and DMARC verification for your
chosen sending domain in the simplest way possible. Delegating a
subdomain to Sendlane lets us handle all the technical details for you!
Sendlane will manage your subdomain‚Äôs DNS while having no control of or
impact on your primary domain.

[[subdomain]]
==== What is a subdomain?

A subdomain is an extension of your primary domain. Subdomains are
typically used to create staging sites to test updates to a website
before they are formally published. In this case, the subdomain you
create will be used as part of the email address you send marketing
content from.

[[inbox]]
==== What does a verified sending domain look like in the inbox?

Let‚Äôs look at two from addresses in the inboxes of a Sendlane staff
member:

image:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/644fff5bcdec2a7348811fc2/file-IVLit2YVK7.jpg[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/644fff5bcdec2a7348811fc2/file-IVLit2YVK7]

This is the from email address on an email recently sent to Sendlane
staff from our CEO, Jimmy. Because Jimmy sent _non-marketing content_ to
Sendlane staff, he used his `+@sendlane.com+` email address which
operates on Sendlane‚Äôs primary domain.

image:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/644fff62cdec2a7348811fc3/file-uxwGDaoj4b.jpg[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/644fff62cdec2a7348811fc3/file-uxwGDaoj4b]

This is the from email address on an email recently sent to everyone who
subscribes to Sendlane‚Äôs (fabulous üíÖ)
https://www.sendlane.com/resources[marketing content] by our Senior
Director of Marketing, Caitlin. Because Caitlin sent _marketing content_
to opted-in subscribers, she used a verified sending domain of
`+@mail.sendlane.com+`¬†* instead of an email address using the primary
`+@sendlane.com+` domain.¬†

Without a verified sending domain, your emails will appear in Contacts'
inboxes with a note next to the from email address saying something like
"via creatensend.com" or "via sldelivery.com". These domains are shared
among non-verified accounts.

*When you verify your own sending domain we suggest _not_ using `+mail+`
as your subdomain due to the high probability that a subdomain of mail
is already in use.

[[primary]]
==== Why can‚Äôt I just use my primary domain to send marketing content?

Businesses should never mix their marketing domain with their corporate
domain or use the same domain for both purposes. If content or links in
a marketing email are flagged by a real-time block list (RBL), email
channels that send and receive email from the primary domain, including
internal and vendor communication, could be blocked for an unknown time.

Delegating a specific sending domain allows Sendlane to maintain and
update your DNS records to protect your business' website and to ensure
that nothing is accidentally changed for your primary domain, causing
domain verification to break for your entire website.

Sendlane continuously monitors the latest developments in domain
verification and security. By delegating a sending domain to Sendlane,
you will benefit from features we add to enhance security!

[[no-subdomain]]
==== I want to take the risks associated with sending from my primary domain. Can I authenticate a Sender Profile using my primary domain without a subdomain?

No, a subdomain is required for verified domains and authenticated
Sender Profiles. Sendlane does not provide domain verification for
primary domains.

'''''

[[default]]
==== Does delegating a subdomain involve changing my default nameservers or giving Sendlane control of my primary domain?

Nope. Your primary domain‚Äôs default nameservers should never be changed
or adjusted on Sendlane‚Äôs behalf. Much like the IRS will never call you
on the phone, Sendlane will never ask you to change or adjust your
default nameservers.

Let‚Äôs say your primary domain is `+example.com+`. Your default
nameservers would look something like:

....
$ dig +short example.com NS
a.iana-servers.net
b.iana-servers.net
....

and will remain completely unchanged by the process of delegating a
subdomain.

You will create a subdomain in your Sendlane account, such as something
like `+mail.example.com+`, then log into your DNS control panel and
create the following _new_ NS records for that subdomain:

[cols=",,,",options="header",]
|===
|Type |Host |Value |TTL
|NS |mail |ns1.sendlane.com |3600
|NS |mail |ns2.sendlane.com |3600
|NS |mail |ns3.sendlane.com |3600
|NS |mail |ns4.sendlane.com |3600
|===

Once the subdomain and new NS records have been created, the following
authentication checks will resolve via Sendlane‚Äôs DNS servers rather
than your primary domain‚Äôs servers:

....
mail.example.com TXT
_dmarc.mail.example.com TXT
slkey1.domainkeys.mail.example.com TXT
....

Sendlane will only process authentication checks at the
`+mail.example.com+` level or above. Sendlane will never control
`+example.com+`.

[[switch]]
==== Will Sendlane still control my subdomain if I switch to another ESP?

Not if you don‚Äôt want us to! You can revoke Sendlane‚Äôs control of your
subdomain at any time by deleting the four NS records you added to
verify your sending domain from your DNS.

'''''

[[multiple]]
==== Can I verify multiple domains or create multiple authenticated senders?

Yes, you can verify multiple domains (for example, store.company.com and
international.company.com can exist in the same Sendlane account) and
create multiple authenticated senders (for example,
hello@store.company.com, email@store.company.com,
hello@international.company.com, and email@international.company.com can
all exist in the same Sendlane account).

'''''

[[hide]]
==== Can I hide the subdomain so that it looks like my emails are being sent from my primary domain?

No, subdomains will always be visible to Contacts in their inboxes. You
can always use an email address associated with your primary domain as
the reply to address:

'''''

[[how]]
==== How are sending domains verified?

Sending domains are verified by:

. Creating a subdomain in Sendlane
. Creating new records in your DNS control panel to delegate the
subdomain to Sendlane
. Attaching an existing or new Sender Profile to the subdomain
