[[why]]
=== Why sending may be temporarily blocked

If your email sends receive too many spam complaints from contacts using
a particular inbox provider or you are sending email from an
unauthenticated sending domain, Sendlane may pause your ability to send
to that inbox provider with that
https://help.sendlane.com/article/433-authenticating-a-sending-domain#inbox[sending
domain] for 24 hours. Any
https://help.sendlane.com/article/550-how-to-authenticate-a-sending-domain#sp[sender
profiles] using the blocked sending domain cannot be used to send email
to that inbox provider for the duration of the block.

You will see a warning message in your Sendlane account if any of your
sending domains are temporarily blocked that will:

. Identify the sending domain being temporarily blocked
. Identify the inbox provider from which a disproportionate amount of
spam complaints originated
. Let you know when the block will be lifted

[[future]]
=== How do I avoid being blocked in the future?

If the sending domain that was blocked was not authenticated,
https://help.sendlane.com/article/550-how-to-authenticate-a-sending-domain[authenticate
it] as soon as possible. Unauthenticated sending domains are the biggest
risk factor for being temporarily blocked.

If the sending domain that was blocked was authenticated, review the
audience and content for the sends that occurred around the time of the
block. You may need to create tighter Segments and more relevant content
so that contacts are not receiving emails they aren't interested in.

[[#campaigns]]
=== How do campaigns work when my sending domain is blocked?

When your sending domain is temporarily blocked for a certain inbox
provider, campaigns that were in progress when the block began and any
that start before the block is lifted will not be sent to contacts who
use the specified inbox provider.

For example, let’s say your sending domain is blocked from sending to
Gmail. If a campaign audience contains 10,000 contacts, 8,000 of whom
use Gmail email addresses, the 8,000 Gmail users will not receive your
campaign, but the 2,000 contacts using other inbox providers will
receive your campaign.

A list of contacts who did not receive the campaign will appear in the
Blocked tab of your campaign report. Emails sent to contacts in the
Blocked tab are considered not delivered.

[[automation]]
=== How do automation email nodes work while my sending domain is blocked?

When a sending profile is blocked, automation email nodes will not be
deactivated, but the email will be blocked from sending to contacts
using the specified inbox provider at the time of the initial block.
contacts using other inbox providers will receive the automation email
as usual.

There is no way to resend the email node to contacts who would have
received it if the block were not in place. A list of contacts who did
not receive the automation email will appear in the Blocked tab of your
automation email report:

[[unblocked]]
=== How do I get my sending domain unblocked?

See the warning message in your Sendlane account for when your sending
domain will be unblocked. There is no way to override or shorten the
block period.
