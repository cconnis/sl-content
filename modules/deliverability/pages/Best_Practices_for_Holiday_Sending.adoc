[[segment]]
=== Use Segments to Target Sends

Segmentation is critical for holiday sending because, on these higher
volume sending days, inbox providers are working overtime to protect
their users' inboxes from unwanted email.

Read our guide to advanced segmentation and create the suggested
Segments if you haven't already, and consider the following practices:

* Offer your Segment of all time non-purchasers a special offer
* Target new subscribers who are engaged with your content but haven't
yet made a purchase by creating a Segment like the following:
** Subscription date is during the timeframe that makes up the current
holiday season, AND
** Clicked > Recent > X > Days, OR
** Opened > Recent > X > Days, AND
** eCommerce integration >Â Store > order > Fulfilled (or the order
status your store uses to indicate a completed order) > Does Not Exist
