When viewing your
https://help.sendlane.com/article/321-email-reporting-breakdown[reporting
data] for campaigns or automations, at some point, you'll see a
percentage of Bounced emails. Anytime an email bounces, that means that
the receiving server rejected the email. But that could be caused by a
few different things!

There are two types of bounced emails:

* link:#hard[Hard Bounces]
* link:#soft[Soft Bounces]

Your bounce rate is a big part of overall deliverability. Continuously
sending to email addresses that bounce can negatively affect your sender
reputation, so your goal should be to keep this number as low as
possible.

[[hard]]
=== Hard Bounces

A hard bounce means that the email cannot be delivered for a
_permanent_ reason, for example: 

* the email address is fake or invalid (misspellings happen more often
than you'd think!)
* the domain does not exist
* the contact is not accepting emails
* the account has been closed 

Contacts within your account that have registered as a hard bounce will
immediately be added to your suppression list so they cannot be sent
another email.

'''''

[[soft]]
=== Soft Bounces

A soft bounce means that the email cannot be delivered for a _temporary_
reason, for example:

* the contact's inbox is full
* the email is too large
* the contact's email server is overloaded, experiencing delays or is
offline 

We will continue trying to deliver to a soft-bounced contact a few times
before it is considered a hard-bounce and added to

=== Troubleshooting

While there's no way to specifically tell what the bounce reason is (and
most of them are outside of your control as a sender) the most common
kind of soft bounce is actually __Blocked Due to Content __which means
the email itself was caught by a junk filter for spammy content.
