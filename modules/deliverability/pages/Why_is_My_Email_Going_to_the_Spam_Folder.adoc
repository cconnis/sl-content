==== Overview

No one wants their email to hit the spam folder, and while many
mechanisms that determine when an email ends up in spam are opaque to
marketers, Sendlane is here to help you avoid the spam folder! Read on
to learn about the most common reasons emails end up in spam, how
Sendlane protects you, and what you can do to avoid the spam folder.

==== In This Guide

There are 4 main factors in determining whether an email hits the inbox
or the spam folder:

. link:#content[Content]
. link:#subject[Subject Lines]
. link:#links[Links]
. link:#email[Email Address Issues]

'''''

=== Content

===== Pre-Written Templates

When email service providers (ESPs) see many different senders trying to
deliver the exact same content, their algorithms detect the copied
content and will stop inboxing emails that use it. 

Whenever you use pre-existing content, you need to rework it before
sending it so that you can be sure it is unique. You can use
pre-existing content as a guide, but make the emails your own to help
increase your deliverability.

===== Email "Curse Words"

In addition to crawling for duplicate content, email providers also have
filters on specific words that are frequently seen in spam emails.

For a more detailed (but not exhaustive) list of words you should avoid
in your emails, check out the
https://blog.sendlane.com/email-curse-words/?s=curse[Email Curse Word
Database]. While you are following this list, remember: your goal is to
always stand out!

====== Please Note

While it’s true that spam filters look specifically for these words, the
chances of your messages being marked as spam will differ based on your
own link:#email[sending reputation]. Maintaining your sender reputation
with a hygienic and engaged list is key to being able to use these words
more freely!

===== Imagery, Formatting, and Special Characters

Adding excessive text formatting (like bold, italics, different font
sizes or colors) and special characters or punctuation (like !!, $$, ...
or ==>) is a huge red flag for spam filters.

Stock images that are available online for anyone to use are another
great way to get flagged for duplicate content. 

Start off sending simple messages with fewer images and text
modifications. And be sure to use _original_ images (like your own logo
and product photos) for best results.

====== Please Note

Once you've built up your link:#email[sender reputation] with a few
sends that engage well, your content will start to inbox more
consistently and you can start sending more "fancy" messages.

[[subject]]
=== Subject Lines

Subject lines can actually be more important than the body of your
messages!

When you think about grabbing your audience’s attention, you should
always go for shorter and more compelling sentences. Be clever and grab
attention with just 5 words or so.

Also, it's important to be honest. Your subject line must  *_directly_*
relate to the content that you're sending within the body of your
message, and avoid using anything that could potentially be deceptive
(especially like "RE:" or referencing order numbers since marketing
emails aren't transactional).

Avoiding words in the
https://blog.sendlane.com/email-curse-words/?s=curse[Email Curse Word
Database] is important when crafting subject lines as well.

=== Links

===== Masking Links

You should always avoid displaying a raw link. More people click on
masked links than raw links, so be sure to mask your links in text or in
a button!

[[email]]
=== Email Address Issues

As an email marketer, you need to establish where you're sending from. 
_Building up a healthy sender reputation is very important!_

According to DMARC’s most recent legislation, in order to send marketing
emails, you are required to have your own
https://help.sendlane.com/article/108-custom-domains-email-addresses[domain-based
email address], backed by a corporate website. DMARC is the email
validation system that helps prevent email abuse including spam,
phishing, fraud and other email-based scams. 

If your business domain is brand new, your domain is essentially a blank
slate. Similar to how a credit score starts off very low before you've
built up credit, you improve your rating by showcasing responsible
spending. You also need to build up your domain/sender reputation with
responsible  _sending!_

When your
https://help.sendlane.com/article/107-how-to-create-a-sender-profile["from"
email address] is unknown to Gmail and other providers, algorithms set
up to detect spam will be monitoring the address, subject line, and
content of your emails very closely. 

====== Please Note

If you have multiple Spam complaints against your domain or a poor
sender reputation, you will have a hard time inboxing any of your
campaigns - regardless of the content.

[[testing]]
=== Testing Your Emails

Testing is one of the most important parts of the email marketing
process. It helps ensure that the messages you send will actually be
delivered to your recipients - and that everything looks the way you
want it to.

If you _don’t_ test, your emails may end up in your contacts' spam
folders without you ever knowing it!

==== How to Test

. Start by making sure that your “from” email address is not in your
address book or allowed/approved list (this will skew your test)
. Create new "test email" accounts in Gmail and Yahoo (these are widely
used services) to send test emails to
. https://help.sendlane.com/article/318-building-the-perfect-email[Build
your email] (subject line, content, links, etc.)
. Once your email is ready, click the "*...*" and then select *Send
Test* to send yourself a
copyimage:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/6556ad259b9e4a1529900509/file-ruV98Es4UI.png[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/6556ad259b9e4a1529900509/file-ruV98Es4UI]
. Check to see where your test email lands
* If you find it in your inbox - great! You can stop testing and send
away!
* If you find it in your spam folder or it never arrives, it's time to
revisit the list of Spam factors one-by-one
. Revisit your content
* If you started from a template, rework the text so it feels more
unique
* Check to be sure you're not using anything listed in the curse word
database
* Simplify your formatting and remove special characters or images
. Once you've made changes, repeat Step 4. 
* If your new version _still_ lands in spam or never arrives, keep
testing:
. Tweak your subject line, then send another test
. Check your links and send a new test
. Swap out the email address in your sender profile and send another
test

=== Testing Outside of Sendlane

The testing functionality inside Sendlane works like a charm, but it'll
never hurt to implement a bit more testing! Luckily, there are other
services out there whose purpose is to ensure your Email Marketing is
efficient and problem-free before you send. 

Here are a few platforms that offer Inbox Placement Testing:

=== Notes 

Moving forward, keep in mind that deliverability depends on 
_many_ different factors including everything listed above, as well as
your contact's email service provider. Each ESP ultimately has their own
unique spam filters and algorithms to parse the content of incoming
emails. Because of that, delivering consistently to some email domains
can bit more difficult. ESPs, like Microsoft and Gmail, have harsher
spam filters and can send emails to other inbox folders.

That said, Sendlane offers world-class deliverability, especially to
Gmail-based accounts which is what the majority of people use today!
