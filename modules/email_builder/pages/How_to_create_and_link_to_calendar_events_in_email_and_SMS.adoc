=== Create a link to a calendar event

Once you've created the event you want to share on your calendar, you'll
need to access the event's URL or file to share it. Use the instructions
linked below for your preferred calendar app to learn how to find the
URL or file:

Google Calendar provides a URL for events, while Apple, Outlook, and
many other calendar apps provide .ICS files.Â If your preferred calendar
provides an .ICS file instead of a URL for the event, you will need to
host the .ICS file on your website or in your preferred file sharing
service so you can access a link to the file to insert in your email or
SMS message.
