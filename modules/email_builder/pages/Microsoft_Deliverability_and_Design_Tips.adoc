Microsoft owns common email domains including, but not limited to:

* @hotmail.com
* @outlook.com
* @live.com
* @msn.com

These domains are grouped together in your

Microsoft is known for its robust filters and security features that
protect its users from unwanted email communication.

You may have noticed that Microsoft email addresses tend to have lower
open, click, and conversion rates than other email providers.¬†You may
have also noticed that your email content looks off when viewed in
Microsoft accounts compared to other inbox providers.

These content and deliverability quirks happen because Microsoft‚Äôs
security features and the varied rendering process used by its apps
(mobile and desktop) can end up blocking or not rendering certain
content in marketing emails that users want to receive.

Read on to learn how to optimize your infrastructure and content for
Microsoft!

[[deliverability]]
=== Deliverability Tips

[[auth]]
==== Use an Authenticated Sending Domain

Microsoft is unlikely to deliver your email without an authenticated
sending domain or standalone¬†SPF record set up. Authenticated sending
domains provide DMARC authentication to your ‚Äúfrom‚Äù email.

Microsoft formerly quarantined non-authenticated domains in the
junk/spam folder, but as of 3/22/23, ‚Äúwill now honor the DMARC record of
https://mxtoolbox.com/dmarc/details/dmarc-tags/dmarc-policy-options[‚Äúp=reject‚Äù]
by rejecting the message [entirely] if the domain fails DMARC.‚Äù

Authenticated sending domains include SPF, DKIM, and DMARC
authentication, in that order. DMARC is the last check before an email
is ultimately rejected, accepted, or quarantined by an inbox provider
like Microsoft.

[[behalf]]
===== üôã¬† Why do my emails sent from an authenticated sender say "on behalf of" in the Contact's inbox?

Microsoft‚Äôs mobile apps and Outlook 365 for desktop use a stricter
method for displaying ‚Äúfrom‚Äù addresses than other inbox providers.

Microsoft ignores the newer https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc5322[RFC
5322] standard used by most other inbox providers, which tells inboxes
how to interpret and display authenticated ‚Äúfrom‚Äù email addresses, in
favor of the older https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc822[RFC 822]
standard, which tells inboxes to display the actual sender without
interpretation.

Because the ‚Äúon behalf of‚Äù originates with Microsoft, there is currently
no way to change this in your Sendlane account. Sendlane's development
team is considering possible solutions that may address how Microsoft
displays authenticated sending domains in certain Microsoft apps.

[[content]]
=== Content Issues

Below is a list of adjustments Microsoft makes to how emails display,
and tips for avoiding them.

[[images]]
==== Images are not downloaded by default

Microsoft‚Äôs default settings do not download images automatically.

This can result in Contacts seeing an email that looks blank or, worse,
full of security warnings if it is too image heavy and they have not
turned on automatic image downloading or
https://help.sendlane.com/article/431-how-to-whitelist-an-email-address[added
you to their always allow list].

Tips:

. Reduce the number of images in your email
. Use ALT text for all images in your email
. Make all crucial information and calls to action text based

[[crop]]
==== Large images are cropped

Microsoft crops images that are taller than 1728px, leaving a cut off
image in the Contact‚Äôs inbox.

Tips:

. Use small images
. Do not use HTML to resize images; Microsoft will ignore it and render
the original image size
. Check your image‚Äôs dimensions in the email builder

image:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/64399b0837fd073d73d6c8c5/file-Gk7rA7m6DS.jpg[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/64399b0837fd073d73d6c8c5/file-Gk7rA7m6DS]¬†This
image will likely be cropped in Microsoft inboxes and should be resized
to a maximum height of 1728px.

[[gif]]
==== ¬†.GIF images do not play

Microsoft does not show a .GIF‚Äôs animation. Instead, it renders just the
first frame of the .GIF.

Tips:

. Do not use .GIFs to communicate any crucial information
. Review your .GIF‚Äôs first frame and make sure it fits in with the rest
of your email content

[[buttons]]
==== Buttons do not match the preview shown in the email builder

Microsoft does not render border radius options, meaning all buttons
will be square in Microsoft inboxes.

Tips:

. Preview buttons as both square and rounded if using rounded corners

[[colors]]
==== Colors are not transparent

Microsoft does not support transparent colors and will render them at
full opacity.

Tips:

. Do not use transparency in your email design
. If you must use transparency, preview your design at your desired
transparency and at full opacity
