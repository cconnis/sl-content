[[before]]
=== Before Getting Started

These emails are intended to be created within a Shopify
https://help.sendlane.com/article/77-retarget-shopify-abandoned-cart-customers['Recover
Abandoned Cart' Automation]. 

Before following these steps, please be sure your
https://help.sendlane.com/article/96-how-to-integrate-shopify-and-sendlane[Shopify
integration] is complete and you have created an automation with
_Shopify Customer Abandoned Checkout_ as the initial trigger. 

====== Please Note

Some of these features will not work unless the email is being created
within an abandoned cart automation.

=== Building Your Email

This step-by-step guide was designed around building a message from
scratch. If you're using the pre-built Shopify Abandoned Cart Checkout
automation, some of these items will already be pre-filled for you -
please make edits accordingly to customize your message!

. Select the first *_Email_* action, use the _Send Email_ toolbar
and follow the prompts to build your first message.
. Give your email a name (this will not be seen by customers), craft a
compelling subject line and enter any preheader text you'd like. The
subject line and preheader are the first things your contacts will see,
so be sure to write something that will grab their attention!

. Next, add any optional settings, select your _Sender Profile_ and then
click *_Create Email_* to design your message.

. If you'd like, you can use one of our pre-designed templates, but for
this example we will choose *Start From Scratch* in the Design section.
. Remind your customer where they were shopping by adding your logo to
the top of your email, and then tell them why you're emailing them. Use
an exciting headline with a short description that entices them to
complete their
purchase. image:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5ea23c2404286364bc98eb95/file-k5h4BGRN6B.png[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5ea23c2404286364bc98eb95/file-k5h4BGRN6B]
. Our deep data integration with Shopify empowers you to include photos
of the items your customer had added to their cart. To include this,
under the _Content_ tab, drag the *_Abandoned Cart_* icon into your
email. image:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/60c902d1fa6e7d669e9d65fe/file-SRJAKZOndL.png[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/60c902d1fa6e7d669e9d65fe/file-SRJAKZOndL] +
 +
. This dynamic content block will display _up to 4 items_ from your
visitor's abandoned cart, including pictures, names & prices! Next, drag
the *_Button_* icon into your email to add a _Complete Your Order_
button. This will direct your customer right back to their abandoned
shopping cart for quick and easy check out!

. Once you're done designing your email, click _Save and continue_ to
finalize the content of your message.

====== Please Note

While our current deep data integration with Shopify allows for
abandoned cart items to be displayed, other eCommerce integrations do
not yet have this option. However, you can still engage contacts with a
follow-up email to encourage a sale.

=== Next Steps

Sending a short series of targeted follow-up emails is a great way to
keep your product top-of-mind and entice more conversations. So, go
ahead and continue creating and adding abandoned cart retargeting emails
to your automation sequence.

Be sure to add a wait time between the emails so your customers don't
receive them all at once!

[[email-content]]
=== Email Content Tips

===== Provide Customization Options

If you offer any type of customization, try highlighting those options
in your abandoned cart message! This is a great way to boost
conversions, especially since customers may have missed that detail the
first time around in your store.

* Offer a variety of colors
* Provide a range of product sizes, such as a trial or travel size
* Highlight a variety of shapes 

===== Overcome Common Buyer Objections

Think about the most common customer objections you face, the FAQ’s you
receive most often, or the top reason for product returns. Address those
concerns head-on in your abandoned cart email copy.

* List 10 real reasons your customer will miss out if they abandon their
cart
* List 5-10 lighthearted/funny reasons why they need your product
* Compile the lists, add some
https://help.sendlane.com/article/152-how-to-use-emojis-in-your-emails[emojis]
and VOILA! You have a compelling (and entertaining) list of why the
customer should go back and commit to the checkout

===== Offer a Discount

Discount codes are a simple and effective way to boost sales and bring
customers back.

* Create a custom discount code specifically for abandoned cart
customers
* Use a scratch card to make the discount offer more entertaining

===== Get Right to the Point

Creating a clean abandoned cart email template allows your customer to
focus in on the product that they left behind. This works exceptionally
well for physical products - without a busy background or a lot of copy,
product photos really stand out!

* Use crisp and clear typography
* Stick with a simple color scheme
* Use icons rather than text
* Make use of negative space
* Use one of Sendlane's pre-designed email marketing templates

===== Use a "Limited-Time-Only" Free Shipping Approach

The limited-time-anything approach is a great way to encourage
conversions, especially when it's paired with free shipping! Cart
abandoners will feel compelled to make a decision quickly because they
don't want to miss out.

* Offer free shipping with no limitation or minimums
* Free shipping at a certain $ threshold (i.e., spend $50 or more)
* Free shipping for members only
* Free shipping on select items
* Free shipping for a limited time
