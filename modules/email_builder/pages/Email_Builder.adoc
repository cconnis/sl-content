[[recreate]]
=== Recreate Legacy Emails

Because emails cannot be transferred from the legacy builder to the new
builder, you'll need to recreate any email templates you want to
continue using for Campaigns or Automations in the new builder. This is
a great time to review your email templates and
https://www.sendlane.com/resources[Sendlane's many resources] for
building awesome emails!

Here are just a few that will help you decide which templates to bring
over and how to optimize them:

[[files]]
=== Use Hyperlinks to Images or Text for Large Files

Sending marketing emails with attachments, large files, or videos can
trigger spam filters and cause bounced emails, negatively affecting your
email deliverability. Using hyperlinks to files avoids these
deliverability issues and allows you to add Tags to Contacts who click
your links!

. Upload your file to the file hosting service of your choice
. Copy the shareable link to your file
. Highlight text or select an image
.. For text links, click the link icon
.. For image links, find the Link field in the Image Settings left-hand
slideout
. Insert the link to your file
. Click the Tag dropdown and select a Tag to apply to Contacts who click
on your text or image link

[[default]]
=== Set Default Values for Personalization Tags

In Sendlane's legacy email builder, there wasn't a way to set default
values for personalization tags which meant that Contacts without data
in the selected tag would see a blank space. Now, you can enter a
default to show when Contacts don't have data in the personalization tag
you want to use!

To set a default value for a personalization tag, add `+| default("")+` 
to the tag and enter your desired default text between the quotation
marks.

For example, to set a default of "Friend" for Contacts without a first
name recorded, select First Name from the tag dropdown:

image:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/630fe4d17164226be0c82157/file-358rlZspER.png[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/630fe4d17164226be0c82157/file-358rlZspER]Then,
edit the tag text to
read  `+{{ contact.first_name | default('Friend') }}+`

[[footer]]
=== Set Custom Styling for Email Footers

Choose background and font colors in your email's footer by clicking
into the footer, selecting Custom for Appearance, and setting your color
preferences. Our contrast calculator will let you know if your
background and font colors are not contrasted enough!

=== Troubleshooting

[[formatting-remove]]
====== My text's formatting looks odd or isn't updating correctly when I adjust its color, size, or font!

If you pasted text from another application into the email builder, the
text may be attempting to retain its formatting from the previous
application. If your text looks off, you can remove all of its
formatting by selecting the text and clicking the remove formatting
button:
