Sendlane's new email builder makes inserting clickable thumbnails from
any YouTube or Vimeo video into a Campaign or Automation email as simple
as pasting a link!

===== ðŸš¦ Before Getting Started

Make sure your video is published and publicly viewable. Videos in draft
or with restricted sharing settings may not embed.

[[[ID TAG]]]
===== ðŸš¨ Video comments can affect deliverability

When inbox providers scan your email for potentially dangerous links,
comments on videos linked in the email are also scanned. Consider
turning off comments for any video you want to link to in an email to
avoid spam comments on a video causing deliverability problems for your
email.
