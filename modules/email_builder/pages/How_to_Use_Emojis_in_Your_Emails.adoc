=== Adding an Emoji to Your Email

When building out campaigns within Sendlane, you can add emojis to the
subject line, preheader and the content of your messages.

. Place your cursor where you'd like to add an emoji (either within the
email**_ Subject_** field, *_Preheader_* field, or a content block
inside of the email editor)
. Open up the emoji panel by using the keyboard shortcut that works for
your device

====== Please Note

Whether the Semicolon or the Period works with the Windows button
depends on your software version. Try one combination, then the other to
figure out which one works for your device.
. Select the emoji you'd like to use from the emoji

And that's it - you'll now be able to display emojis within your email
subject line, preheader and content!

====== Please Note

Emojis render differently across different email clients and devices, so
you'll always want to test your messages before sending to be sure
everything looks exactly how you want.
