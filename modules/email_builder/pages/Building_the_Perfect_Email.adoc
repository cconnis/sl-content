[[elements]]
=== Content Elements

The Sendlane email builder provides the following elements:

====== *Text*

****Best for copy and longer sections of text. Adjust the textâ€™s size,
font family, color, alignment, line height, letter spacing, and add
hyperlinks, text styling or emojis by clicking the text element.

====== *Title*

****Best for titles, headers, or short sections of text. Adjust the
titleâ€™s size, font family, color, alignment, line height, letter
spacing, and add hyperlinks, text styling or emojis by clicking the
title element.

====== *Image*

****Add .JPEG, .PNG, or .GIF images to your emails! There is no file
size limit, and the email builder will resize images for you. We
recommend using an image that has been sized to twice the height and
width you'd like it to display at so the image is optimized for high
pixel density or retina screens.

Add alt text, adjust alignment, size, and corner radius by clicking on
the image element. Images can be made clickable by pasting a link in the
Link field. Linked images can add Tags to Contacts who click the linked
image by selecting or creating a Tag from the Tag dropdown.

====== *Button*

****Create a clickable button with custom text and styling! Buttons can
add Tags to Contacts who click the linked image by selecting or creating
a Tag from the Tag dropdown.

====== *Divider*

****Insert a divider line with custom styling to separate content
sections.

====== *Spacer*

****Insert a spacer to separate content sections without a visible line.

====== *Social*

****Insert links to your companyâ€™s social media profiles! Adjust
styling, social media icons, and links by clicking the social element.

====== *HTML*

****Insert custom HTML!

====== *Media*

****Insert a link to a YouTube or Vimeo video to create a clickable
image of the videoâ€™s thumbnail. Adjust the videoâ€™s alt text, spacing,
and button styles by clicking the media element.

====== *Link Bar*

****Insert a bar with links to any URL you need! Add, rearrange, and
style the link bar by clicking on the link bar element.

[[wrap]]

image! Adjust all text and image settings by clicking on the text wrap
image element.

=== Email Content Best Practices

Sendlane has https://www.sendlane.com/resources[many resources] to help
clarify a winning marketing strategy for your brand! Check out our blog
https://www.sendlane.com/blog/email-design-tips[6 Email Design Tips to
Increase Engagement] for tips on creating a style guide for your brand,
optimizing for mobile devices, personalization, color psychology, and
call-to-action best practices.

In addition to design resources, consult content resources that focus on
how content can affect deliverability, such as
https://help.sendlane.com/article/356-spam-folder[Why is my email going
to the spam folder?]

Here are a few simple rules that can help your email reach as many
Contacts as possible:

* *Emails should be 40% images at most.* Some inbox providers block
automatic image downloading which means Contacts who use those services
will not immediately see any images in your email. Images are also not
readable by screen readers. Use text or buttons whenever possible!
* *Content order matters.* Contacts see the top of your email first; if
the first sections don't grab them, they likely won't continue
scrolling. Keep logo images and generic brand information at the top of
an email as small as possible while still being readable, or consider
moving it to the bottom of the email.
* *Use one call-to-action per email.* When emails have multiple
calls-to-action, Contacts aren't sure which is the most important. Keep
your content focused and concise so Contacts can easily scan it!

Template* > Enter a descriptive name > *Save* > *Save*

[[files]]
=== Create a Hyperlink for Text or Images to Link to Large Files

your links!

. Copy the shareable link to your file
. Highlight text or select an image
.. For text links, click the link icon
.. For image links, find the Link field in the Image Settings left-hand
slideout
. Insert the link to your file
. Click the Tag dropdown and select a Tag to apply to Contacts who click
on your text or image link
