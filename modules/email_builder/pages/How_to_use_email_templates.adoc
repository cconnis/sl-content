[[save]]
=== Save an email as a template

Open a Campaign or Automation email and edit its content. To save an
email as a template:

. Click the  *three-dot menu* 
. Click *Save as Template* 
. Enter a descriptive *name* 
. Click *Save* 

Once you save an email as a template, it will stay in the template
center unless you delete it from the email templates page. If you delete
the original Campaign or Automation email node the template was created
in, it will still be available in the email templates page.

=== Troubleshooting

[[legacy]]
====== I don't see my email template!

If you created your email in Sendlane's legacy email builder, it will
not appear on the Email Templates page. Templates created in the legacy
email builder can still be accessed via the Campaigns page or in
Automations.

[[search]]
====== Why is my template not appearing in the search results?

The search bar on the Email Templates page only searches the text in a
template's name. Make sure you are searching for terms that appear in a
template's link:#name[name].
