Countdown timers in time-sensitive emails (special offers, sales, event
announcements, or holidays) can help encourage your Contacts to respond
to your call to action!

===== ðŸ™‹Â  How does the countdown timer show the correct time for each Contact?

Most countdown generators use the same method: the countdown timer is a
.GIF file that is generated by the countdown creation software's server
each time it is viewed.

  Countdown timers are .GIF files, but you won't be able to use an image
  block to display them because they are dynamic, meaning you can't
  download the image and insert it in an email.Â Instead, we'll use an
  HTML block that allows for more customized styling in addition to
