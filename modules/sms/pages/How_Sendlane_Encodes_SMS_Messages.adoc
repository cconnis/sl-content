Sendlane encodes SMS messages to send in as few segments as possible to
reduce costs for SMS sends.

Read on to learn how your SMS messages are encoded and why emojis and
other special characters increase the number of segments needed to
complete a send!

[[encoding]]
=== What is SMS message encoding?

SMS message encoding is the process of translating the SMS message sent
from Sendlane (text characters and emojis) to mobile carriers (GSM-7 or
UCS-2 standardized characters).

Think of SMS encoding like handwriting recognition software. The
handwritten text is the SMS message you wrote in Sendlane; the resulting
digital text is the encoded SMS message received by mobile carriers.

[[alphabets]]
=== What are GSM-7 and UCS-2?

GSM-7 is an encoding method, or alphabet, used in SMS communication for
languages with more than 128 commonly used characters.

UCS-2 is a “backup” encoding method for characters outside the GSM-7
alphabet.

GSM-7 encoding allows 160 characters per segment, while UCS-2 allows
only 70 characters per segment.

[[segments]]
=== How does Sendlane determine how many segments an SMS message uses?

As long as there are no UCS-2 characters in your SMS message, it will be
encoded as GSM-7 and will use 160 total characters per segment. If there
is one or more UCS-2 character in your SMS message, the message will be
encoded as UCS-2 and sent in 70 character segments.

Sendlane prepends a six Byte user data header for each SMS segment to
specify how mobile carriers should format and process the SMS message.

After the header is applied, GSM-7 encoded segments have 157 characters,
and UCS-2 encoded segments have 67 characters available for content.

[[common]]
=== What are the most common UCS-2 characters that end up in SMS messages?

Modern text editors, the process of copying and pasting, and autocorrect
can inadvertently sneak UCS-2 characters into your SMS message.

Common UCS-2 characters include angled quotes (” vs ”), non-standard
spacing, and other punctuation. Check out the GSM-7 character set
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM_03.38#GSM_7-bit_default_alphabet_and_extension_table_of_3GPP_TS_23.038_.2F_GSM_03.38[here].

[[emojis]]
=== How are emojis encoded?

Emojis are not characters in the GSM-7 standard; therefore, SMS messages
that include emojis are encoded as UCS-2 and will be processed as 67
character segments (excluding the automatically prepended user data
header mentioned above.)

[[check]]
=== How can I check my SMS message for UCS-2 encoding?

When building your SMS message, watch the segment counter in the bottom
right corner of the Text Message field. One emoji takes this example SMS
message from one segment to three!
