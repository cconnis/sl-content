=== Before Getting Started

Please be sure you've started collecting phone numbers for your contacts
prior to sending any SMS messages. You can either create a

use a platform that we integrate with such as
https://a.paddle.com/v2/click/30347/37978?link=1070[Convertful] to
collect phone numbers!

====== International SMS

We do not currently support international SMS at this time due to data
restrictions and privacy regulations, so please be sure the phone
numbers you collect are from US-based contacts only.

*Cannabis Related SMS Content*

Sendlane strictly adheres to all federal communication regulations, and
cannot provide SMS services for cannabis related content due to current
federal regulations prohibiting the use of SMS for cannabis marketing.
Cannabis related content is welcome on Sendlane's platform for email
marketing.
