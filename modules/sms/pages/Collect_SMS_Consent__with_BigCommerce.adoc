=== Confirm SMS Consent in Contact Profiles

Below is an example of what the default structure from the webhook
coming into Sendlane will look like if they have checked the SMS Consent
box (if they do not check the box, no data is sent):

....
$customer->customer_data = [
            'form_fields' => [
                [
                    'name' => 'SMS Consent',
                    'value' => [
                        'Subscribe to marketing texts'
                    ]
                ],
            ]
        ];
....

A green checkmark next to the SMS icon in a Contact’s profile indicates
that they have provided consent to receive SMS messages

=== Troubleshooting

[[values]]
====== I don't see SMS Consent being updated in Contacts' profiles!

Make sure that the Field Name and List of Values in your form matches
the text below exactly:

* *Field Name* `+SMS Consent+`
* *List of Values* `+Subscribe to marketing texts+`

Any variation in these fields will prevent SMS consent from being
recorded in your Contacts' profiles.
