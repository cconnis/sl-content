==== Overview

You can collect SMS marketing consent from new or existing contacts by
using a dynamic hyperlink!

The  `+VAR_SMS_JOIN+` tag in the snippet below will generate a unique
code and SMS link for each contact. When clicked on a mobile device, the
SMS link will open the contact's SMS app with a message draft to your
Sendlane phone number containing their unique consent code. When
contacts send this message containing their unique code, consent to
receive SMS will be recorded in their contact Profile. Messages sent by
contacts to confirm their consent will appear in your Reply Center and
will not cost any SMS credits!

===== ⚠️ SMS consent links will not open on certain devices or inbox providers

Some devices, inbox provider apps, and specific combinations of devices
and inbox provider apps will not render links designed to open an SMS
app to send a message.

If you experience an issue with SMS links, try to recreate it using the
same type of device and the same version of the same app. If the SMS
link does not work in the replicated environment, it is likely that the
device and/or app combination does not support SMS links.

===== ⚠️ SMS consent links do not work in test email sends

To receive a working SMS link, you must use a live email send. Instead
of using the test email function, create a list with the email addresses
you want to receive the "test" email.

=== Include compliance messaging

To collect consent to receive marketing SMS messages, your email, post,
sign-up form, or other medium must contain:

. A link to your terms of service, AND
. A link to your privacy policy, AND
. Clear messaging on the consent your contacts are giving to receive SMS
marketing messages

See the sample message below:

By signing up for texts, you are agreeing to receive marketing text
messages from `+[your business name]+` at the number provided, including
messages sent by autodialer. Consent is not a condition of any purchase.
Message and data rates may apply. Message frequency varies. Reply HELP
for help or STOP to cancel at any time. View our Privacy Policy* and SMS
Terms of Service*.

_*Include hyperlinks to policies_

=== Insert and edit an HTML block

The following method works wherever links are accepted. We'll use an
email sent from your Sendlane account as an example!

. Open any campaign or automation email
. Drag an HTML block into your email
. In the HTML window that appears, delete the Insert HTML Here
placeholder text
. Paste the following HTML snippet in the HTML window:

....
<a href="sms:VAR_SMS_PHONE?&body=Send%20this%20text%20to%20subscribe%20to%20SMS%20Updates! VAR_SMS_JOIN">
    Text us to sign up for SMS updates!
</a>
....

The `+sms:VAR_SMS_PHONE+` tag tells your contacts' SMS app to 1. open
the SMS app and 2. Set your Sendlane phone number as the recipient. The
`+VAR_SMS_JOIN+` tag generates a unique code that confirms their
subscription to your SMS program when sent back to your account's
Sendlane phone number.

To change the text of the hyperlink that will appear in the email you
send to contacts, replace  `+Text us to sign up for SMS updates!+` with
your preferred message.

To change the draft message in contacts' SMS app, edit the
`+Send%20this%20text%20to%20subscribe%20to%20SMS%20Updates!+` text to
your preferred message, ensuring that a `+%20+` remains between each
word. We recommend drafting a message that clearly communicates that
contacts will receive SMS messages from your brand if they choose to
sign up for your SMS program and how often they should expect to be
messaged. To add contacts to specific lists, include an
