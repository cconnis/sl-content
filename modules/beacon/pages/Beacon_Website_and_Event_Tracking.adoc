=== How Does the Beacon Pixel Work?

Sendlane’s Beacon tracking pixel collects information about your
Contacts' pageview and purchase activity by cookie-ing them.

For the pixel to begin tracking, Contacts must be cookied. Contacts are
cookied when they:

. Opt into your emails, and
. Open an email from you, and
. Click a link in an email from you

OR subscribe to your account via a
https://help.sendlane.com/article/634-getting-started-with-sendlane-forms[Sendlane
Form].

[[notes]]
===== ⚠️ The Beacon tracking pixel cannot track visits from anonymous visitors or incognito browsers

If the Beacon tracking pixel is blocked, Contacts will not be tracked in
Beacon reporting or be sent through Automations such as browse and
checkout abandonment. Contacts browsing using the following or other
private browsing methods will not be tracked:

* Safari private browsing on
https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/browse-the-web-privately-iphb01fc3c85[iOS]
and
https://support.apple.com/guide/safari/prevent-cross-site-tracking-sfri40732/mac[macOS]
* Chrome Incognito browsing on
https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95464?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop[iOS&#44;
Android&#44; and desktop]
* Firefox private browsing on

. Click *Inspect*
. Click into the Elements tab

known dollar amount, or you may falsely inflate your

[[segments]]
=== Use Events to Create Segments

https://help.sendlane.com/article/137-segments[Segmenting] contacts
based on their behavior is a great way to send highly targeted content
to your Contacts. To create a Segment based on Event Tracking, use the
*Triggered Event* characteristic.

If you have set up General tracking, you can use your website pages'
slug text to create Segments for specific page(s) visited!

[[slug]]
=== Use General Tracking to Create Segments

General Beacon tracking allows you to create
https://help.sendlane.com/article/137-segments[segments] based on
Contacts' site browsing using a target page's URL slug.

To create a Segment based on Event Tracking, use  *Visited Site*
*contains*. Enter the slug text of the URL(s) you want to track visits
to.
