=== How Does the Beacon Pixel Work?

Sendlane’s Beacon tracking pixel collects information about your
Contacts' pageview and purchase activity by cookie-ing them.

For the pixel to begin tracking, Contacts must be cookied. Contacts are
cookied when they:

. Opt into your emails, and
. Open an email from you, and
. Click a link in an email from you

OR subscribe to your account via a
https://help.sendlane.com/article/634-getting-started-with-sendlane-forms[Sendlane
Form].

===== ⚠️ The Beacon tracking pixel cannot track visits from anonymous visitors or incognito browsers

If the Beacon tracking pixel is blocked, Contacts will not be tracked in
Beacon reporting or be sent through Automations such as browse and
checkout abandonment. Contacts browsing using the following or other
private browsing methods will not be tracked:

* Safari private browsing on
https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/browse-the-web-privately-iphb01fc3c85[iOS]
and
