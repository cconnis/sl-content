==== Overview

Sendlaneâ€™s API allows you to create custom events that can be used to
trigger Automations.Â In this guide, you'll learn how to set up your own
custom triggered automations using a password reset workflow as an
example.

==== In this guide

. Create a custom event in Sendlane
. Create an API call
. Create an automation triggered by the custom event you created

===== ðŸš¦ Before Getting Started

Set up a
https://help.sendlane.com/article/451-custom-integration-setup#js-setup[Sendlane
Custom Integration]

Review Sendlane's
https://sendlane.stoplight.io/docs/api-documentation/92f2bd02d3f75-custom-integration-events[custom
event API documentation]

1::
  Go to your https://app.sendlane.com/integrations/custom[completed
  Sendlane Custom Integration] and click the *Events* icon. On the
  Events page, click *Create Event* > Enter a descriptive name >
  *Create*.
  +
  Weâ€™ll name our example event `+password-reset+`.
  +

2::
  Use a JSON snippet like the following to build a password reset
  request API call:
  +
....
{
   "custom_event": "CUSTOM_EVENT_NAME",
   "token": "CUSTOM_EVENT_TOKEN",
   "email": "jimmykim@sendlane.com",
   "data": {
     "password_reset_url": "https://www.yourwebsite.com/reset/1234567890"
   }
}
....
  +
  * `+custom_event+` - Your custom eventâ€™s name (our example eventâ€™s
  name is `+password-reset+`)
  +
  * `+token+` - Grab the token associated with your custom event by
  heading to the https://app.sendlane.com/integrations/custom[Sendlane
  Custom Integration page] > Click *Settings* > Click *Copy* > Paste in
  place ofÂ CUSTOM_EVENT_TOKEN
  +
  Test your call to confirm your setup. You're good to go if your call
  is successful and you see example data on the custom events page If
  your event does not show data in the example column like the example
  below, review your custom event and API call
  setup:image:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/66a0224cee46f05d48ed0639/file-sRjULvJvPM.png[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/66a0224cee46f05d48ed0639/file-sRjULvJvPM]

3::
  Create an Automation and select the Custom Event trigger from the
  Custom integration tab.

  +
  ==== Trigger Options
  +
  *Store* - Select your store
  +
  *Event* - Select the password-reset event
  +
  *Limit Per Contact* - Select a limit for how and when Contacts are
  sent through the Automation. For our password reset example, we
  selected No Limit so Contacts can reset their password as many times
  as needed.
  +
  * No Limit - The Contact will be sent through the Automation whenever
  the trigger conditions are met
  +
  * Do not trigger when already in Automation - If the trigger
  conditions are met but the Contact is already being sent through the
  Automation, the Contact will not trigger the Automation again
  +
  * Once Per Day - If the trigger conditions are met but the Contact has
  already triggered the Automation on the same day, the Contact will not
  trigger the Automation again
  +
  * One Time Only - Contacts will only trigger the Automation one time
  +
  ==== Add a wait node
  +
  Add a
  https://help.sendlane.com/article/353-how-to-use-goals-and-conditional-splits-in-an-automation#timing[wait
  node] of as the first step of the Automation. For our password reset
  example, weâ€™ll use 1 minute. Wait nodes default to a 1 hour wait.
  +
  [[d5d7c79c-e31a-4b85-9280-aa993301664d]]
  ==== Add an email node
  +
  Create an
  https://help.sendlane.com/article/449-automation-actions#send-message[email
  node] and use https://twig.symfony.com/doc/3.x/[Twig templating
  syntax] to pull in data from the payload.Â Sendlane supports a subset
  of the Twig language.
  +
  ===== Variables
  +
  Creating variables allows you to populate data in your email using
  templating syntax.
  +
  For our password reset example, weâ€™ll want to be able to populate the
  name of our event and data from the payload in our API call. Weâ€™ll
  need two variables; `+name+` to access the eventâ€™s name and `+data+`
  to access data from the payload, including a URL to the password reset
  page.
  +
  To create variables, add a text box element to your email, then copy
  and paste the following snippets into the text box. The snippets will
  not be visible to Contacts who receive your email, they are only
  visible to you inside the Sendlane email builder.
  +
....
{% set name = trigger.getCustomEventName() %}
{% set data = trigger.getCustomEventData() %}
....
  +
  Once these variables are in place, they can be used to populate data!
  +
  [[data]]
  ===== Populating data in an email
  +
  In link:#2[step 2], we made the API call with the following JSON
  payload
  +
....
{
   "token": "1234abcd5678edfg",
   "email": "jimmykim@sendlane.com",
   "custom_event": "password-reset",
   "data": {
     "password_reset_url": "https://www.yourwebsite.com/reset/456789745"
   }
}
....
  +
  Now that weâ€™ve set up our `+data+` variable, we can access the
  `+password_reset_url+` via templating syntax:
  +
....
{{-data.password_reset_url-}}
....
  +
  Pasting this snippet directly into the email will display a raw
  password reset link. Use the hyperlink function in the email builder,
  a button, or a custom HTML block to hyperlink the URL.
  +
  In the email below, our `+{{-data.password_reset_url-}}+`Â is made into
  a hyperlink, and our variable scripts disappear when the email is
  previewed.
