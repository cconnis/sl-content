Using Sendlane's API, you can connect different tools, applications, and
platforms to sync data back and forth as needed.

Your API Key, API Hash Key, and Subdomain are unique identifiers,
specific to your Sendlane account, that connect both sides of an
integration to pass information directly.

* *API Key* - a secret key that allows other programs to access API
calls
* *Hash Key* - another version of your API key with extra added security
* *Subdomain* - a unique name (similar to an account number or customer
ID) for your Sendlane account 

====== Please Note

Your Sendlane subdomain is not public to your contacts and cannot be
changed.

Plus we'll offer link:#additional[additional resources] about our
currently available native integrations!

From here, you can copy and paste your API Key, API Hash Key, and
Subdomain and use them as needed to integrate your Sendlane account with
your favorite other marketing tools!

====== Please Note

Some platforms call for the subdomain in _*subdomain*.sendlane.com_
format when verifying your Sendlane account details during the
integration process. 

If the  *_subdomain_* does not work on its own please try this variation
as well!
