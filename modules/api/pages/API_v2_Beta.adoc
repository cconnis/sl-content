=== Before Getting Started

Sendlane’s API v2 requires an API Token that is generated in your
Sendlane account. Follow the guide below to grab your API Token:

Click the *_Account_* icon → *_API_* → *_Create API Token_*

Enter a *_Token name_* for the API token → *_Create_*

Clicking Create will open the _Access Token created_ window. Use the
*_Copy API Token_* button to copy the entire token. You must copy the
API Token at this step and store it somewhere secure.

The API Token cannot be accessed again after exiting the Access Token
created window.

=== Troubleshooting

*I’m getting a “Could not get any response” error!*

If you are located outside the United States and using a proxy, a “Could
not get any response” error can sometimes be resolved by turning the
proxy off.
