access Sendlane’s API Documentation, which contains a full index of
Sendlane’s API calls and how to implement them!

=== Before Getting Started

In order to use the Sendlane API, you'll need to have your your Sendlane
API Key, Hash Key and Subdomain ready. These can be found in your
Sendlane account under https://app.sendlane.com/api[_*Account* →
*API*_].

====== Please Note

If you are located _outside_ of the US and have a proxy set up, you may
experience issues making successful API calls.

Turning off your proxy is the best option for troubleshooting an error
where the system “Could not get any response.”
