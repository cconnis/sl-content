== Authorization
[IMPORTANT]
.You need two separate tokens to set up a custom integration:
====
. A bearer token (manually generated in your account settings) for access to Sendlane's v2 API
. A custom integration token (automatically generated when creating a new custom integration) that is required as a parameter for all interactions with:
* The Sendlane v2 API
* Custom integration calls
* Onsite behavior
====

=== Generate and store a bearer token
Bearer tokens blah blah blah expire after a year etc
