=== Before Getting StartedÂ 

In order for List Hygiene to run, your account must have at least one
List with Contacts who have been in your Sendlane account for at least
30 days and have received at least one email.

If you'd like to remove inactive Contacts that have been in your account
for less than 30 days, useÂ Segments. Learn more about that process

=== Smart List HygieneÂ 

Use Smart List Hygiene to remove Contacts at one point in time rather
than on an ongoing basis.

Smart List Hygiene is the default first tab in the List Hygiene window.
To run Smart List Hygiene:

. Set the *number of days*Â (between 10 and 365) of inactivity to run
Smart List Hygiene for
. Click *Remove inactive contacts*

Once the process is complete, inactive Contacts will be removed from
your List and you'll receive an email with an export .CSV file that
includes all of the removed Contacts' details.

[[automatic]]
=== Automatic List Hygiene

Use Automatic List Hygiene if you'd like to have unengaged Contacts
removed automatically! To enable Automatic List Hygiene:

. Click the *Automatic* tab on the List Hygiene window
. Click the toggle to *Enabled*
. Choose a *number of days* of inactivity (we suggest 60)
. Choose a *frequency* for Automatic List Hygiene (we suggest every 14
days)
. Click *Update Automatic Hygiene*

Every time Automatic List HygieneÂ runs, Contacts will be removed
according to the unengagement settings you've specified and you'll
receive an email with an export .csv file that includes details on the
Contacts that were removed.

[[history]]
=== List Hygiene History

The History tab shows the date and time of all past List Hygiene
processes, the number of Contacts removed during each process, and the
ability to download a .csv file of the removed Contacts' details or the
option to restore the removed Contacts to the List.

[[restoring]]
===== ðŸš¨ Important Note

Sending to unengaged contacts can severely harm your deliverability,
open rates, and sender reputation.

Be cautious when restoring contacts removed by list hygiene. Contacts
who were not engaging with your content are unlikely to start engaging
again.
