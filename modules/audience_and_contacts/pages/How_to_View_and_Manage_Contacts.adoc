[[contact-statuses]]
=== About Contact Subscription Statuses

Contacts are divided into 3 mutually exclusive subscription statuses for
email and SMS - Subscribed, Unsubscribed, and Suppressed. Contacts'
subscription statuses are notated in Contact profiles via the email and
SMS icons; green for subscribed and red for unsubscribed. Suppressed
Contacts can be viewed

==== Subscribed

Subscribed Contacts include active Contacts who have agreed to receive
your content and are subscribed to at least one of your Lists.Â A Contact
is no longer subscribed to a List if they unsubscribe or if
https://help.sendlane.com/category/167-campaigns[Campaigns] sent to
their email address
https://help.sendlane.com/article/355-bounced-emails[bounce].

==== Unsubscribed

Contacts are considered Unsubscribed if they previously agreed to
receive content from you, but have since opted out of all of your
content. Contacts will have the Unsubscribed status if they have
actively unsubscribed from all Lists. Contacts who are still subscribed
to at least one List will show as Subscribed.

Unsubscribed Contacts can opt out themselves by clicking the unsubscribe
link in your email, reaching an unsubscribe action within an

page to unsubscribe the Contact from all Lists in your account
. Clicking the *circled X* button next to the List in the Lists section

==== Suppressed

Contacts that have been Suppressed are added to the
https://help.sendlane.com/article/135-suppression[Global Suppression
List] and are unable to receive emails of any kind, including Campaigns
and Automations. Contacts are considered Suppressed after they make a
spam complaint. Unsubscribing does not suppress Contacts.

Any email addresses that return a
