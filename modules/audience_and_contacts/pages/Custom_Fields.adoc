included in any actions that depend on the Custom Field and the field
will appear blank for that Contact.

Be cautious when creating Custom Fields! Custom Fields cannot be deleted
from your Sendlane account once they are created.

=== Using Custom Fields

Custom Fields can be used to add personalization to emails and as
powerful segmentation options.

==== Insert a Custom Field in an Email

Custom Fields are a great way to personalize your
https://help.sendlane.com/article/153-campaigns[Campaign] and Automation
emails! Custom fields can be used as
https://help.sendlane.com/article/79-what-are-personalization-tags[personalization
tags] in any email:

. Click into the email wherever you want your Contacts' Custom Field
data to appear
. Click the *three dot menu*
. Click the *personalization* icon
. Click the *Select Personalization* dropdown
. Click the *Custom Field* you want to insert

image:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/645c13d6817a7b0924b22dec/file-aU3J9lxxck.jpg[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/645c13d6817a7b0924b22dec/file-aU3J9lxxck]If
Contacts have data for the selected Custom Field, they'll see their data
where the personalization tag was inserted:

image:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/645c14d3213fbb442001de68/file-VCdodHcF0c.jpg[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/645c14d3213fbb442001de68/file-VCdodHcF0c]

==== Create a Default Value for Custom Fields

If Contacts do not have data for the selected Custom Field, they will
see a blank space where the personalization tag was inserted if a
default value is not specified for the Custom Field.

To create a default value for a Custom Field:

. Click the Audience icon
. Click the Personalization tab
. Click the Custom Field's tag to copy it
. Paste the Custom Field where you want it to appear
. Add `+ | default('') +`before the closing curly brackets
. Enter the default value between the quotation marks

In the favorite color example used above, the final personalization tag
would look like
`+{{ contact.custom('Favorite Color') | default('pink') }}+`

[[trigger]]
==== Trigger Automations with Custom Fields

Select *Custom field added* as a trigger in an Automation to start an
Automation when Contacts fill out a Pop-Up with the Custom Field you
select.

Custom Fields can also be used in Conditional Splits in Automations. In
the Conditional Split sidebar, select *Custom Fields* from the Condition
dropdown, then adjust your parameters for the splitâ€™s logic depending on
your Contactsâ€™ Custom Field data.

==== Use Custom Fields to Create Segments

https://help.sendlane.com/article/137-segments[Segmenting] by Custom
Fields is a great way to target specific audiences to send to! You can
create Segments based on any Custom Field.

=== TroubleshootingÂ Â 

*I don't see Custom Field data for a Contact!*

Be sure the data point was collected in their contact profile! Without
that information, the variable tag will not have anything to pull from.
Some Custom Fields, such as Contact Phone number, are not able to pull
data when used in an email's subject line.

*I donâ€™t see Custom Field data in my test email!*

Custom Field tags will not populate with Custom Field data in test
emails. To ensure that your email renders Custom Field data properly,
make sure that the correct Custom Field VAR code appears in your email.

*How do I delete a Custom Field?*

Custom Fields cannot be deleted.
