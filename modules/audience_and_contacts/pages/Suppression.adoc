[[emails]]
=== Methods of Email Address Suppression

Contacts are automatically suppressed by Sendlane if they meet certain
criteria, but they can also be manually suppressed.

[[automatic-contact]]
==== Automatic Contact Suppression

Contacts are suppressed automatically by Sendlane when:

* An email cannot be delivered and results in a
https://help.sendlane.com/article/355-bounced-emails[hard bounce], that
email address is automatically suppressed
* A Contact clicks the spam/junk button in an email, it is registered as
a “complaint” against the sender to the Contact's Internet Service
Provider. Sendlane participates in all known feedback loop programs for
receiving notifications of spam complaints, and our system adds email
addresses to Suppression when we are notified that the email address
registered spam complaints on an email sent from Sendlane.
