1::
  A contact card is a .VCF file that stores contact information in any
  system designed to store contact information, including smart phones
  and email providers.
  +
  There are two ways to create a contact card:
  +
  . Use an online .VCF file generator like
  https://vcardmaker.com/[vcardmaker.com]. We recommend this method
  because it provides many customization options and will be
  standardized across inbox providers. Enter your brand's information,
  then click Generate at the bottom of the page to download your .VCF
  file.
  . Use your email provider's address book functionality to download a
  .VCF file. We do not recommend this method because the contact card
  may only appear to Contacts who use the inbox provider the file was
  generated from.
2::
  Share your contact card via email and SMS messages by creating a
  download link for your .VCF file and including that link in an email
  or SMS message:
  +
  . Log in to a cloud storage service like Google Drive or Dropbox
  . Upload your .VCF file
  . Set sharing options to public or viewable by anyone
  . Follow instructions for your cloud storage service to create an
  automatic download link¬† +

  message that sends them the link
