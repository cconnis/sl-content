=== Troubleshooting

*My 'From Email' is not being accepted!*

Ensure you are using a valid custom domain email address and that there
are no typos or spaces in the email address field.

*My email wasÂ sent using the wrong Sender Profile!*

Review the Campaign or Automation email's assigned Sender Profile. If
the correct Sender Profile is selected, please reach out to our Support
Team.
