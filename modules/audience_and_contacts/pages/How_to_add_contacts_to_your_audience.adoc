[[contacts=bgs]]
===== üö¶ Before Getting Started

¬†Create at least one https://help.sendlane.com/article/125-lists[List]
for new contacts to be added to

¬†Ensure that all contacts' opt-in details¬†(date, IP Address, and source)
are recorded

'''''

[[import-file-format]]
=== How to format a file of contacts for import

¬†*Size*: Ensure your file is 250MB or smaller.

¬†*Headers*: All columns must have descriptive headers with no special
characters.

¬†*Required data*: Email address, sign-up source, subscribed date, and
sign-up IP are required for all rows. Proof of sending through another
ESP is acceptable if you do not have the sign-up IP for all rows.

*Email and SMS Consent*: The Email and SMS Consent columns determine
whether or not the contact has given you consent to receive marketing
emails or SMS messages. The following values (case insensitive) will be
accepted:

* `+Subscribed+` / `+Unsubscribed+`
* `+True+` / `+False+`
* `+Yes+` / `+No+`
* `+1+` / `+0+`
* `+On+`¬†/¬†`+Off+`

¬†*Phone Numbers*:

* Do not include a `+++` symbol without a country code in the phone
number column
* Rows with an affirmative indicator for SMS consent must contain a
valid phone number.

[[understanding-import]]
=== How imports affect contacts' subscription status

Contacts' subscription status in your Sendlane account can change
depending on whether the contact already exists in your account, the
values used in the email and SMS consent columns, and whether the fields
are mapped before import. Read the sections below to learn how the email
and SMS consent columns affect contacts' subscription status.

[[email-consent-column]]
===== Email Consent

Review the following table to learn how mapping the Email Consent column
will affect contacts with different statuses in your account during
import:

[cols=",,",]
|===
|*New contact?* |*Subscription Status Before Import* |*Email Consent
(EC) Column Value and Mapping*

|Yes |N/A |Yes, with EC column mapped

|Yes |N/A |Blank, No, or unsupported value with EC column mapped

|Yes |N/A |EC column not mapped

|Yes |Unsubscribed (from previous ESP) |No, with EC column mapped

|Yes |Unsubscribed (from previous ESP) + |EC column NOT mapped

|No |Subscribed to Email |Yes, with EC column mapped

|No |Subscribed to Email |Blank, No, or unsupported value with EC column
mapped

|No |Subscribed to Email |EC column not mapped

|No |Unsubscribed from Email |Yes, with EC column mapped

|No |Unsubscribed from Email |Blank, No, or unsupported value with EC
column mapped

|No |Unsubscribed from Email |EC column not mapped
|===

[[ec-yes]]
===== ‚ö†Ô∏è *If you do not map the Email Consent column, all NEW contacts will be imported with email consent = yes

If you are uploading a list of contacts who are new to your Sendlane
account and the Email Consent column is not mapped, they will be
imported with email consent automatically set to yes. Doing this may
mean you send to contacts who have not consented to receive your
marketing emails and may result in increased spam complaints from these
contacts.

[[sms-consent-column]]
===== SMS Consent

If the SMS consent column is mapped during import, the consent value in
the import file will overwrite the consent value in the contact's
profile as long as the contact was originally subscribed via import.

If contacts unsubscribe from SMS by texting STOP, the SMS consent value
will not be overwritten by future imports.

'''''

[[sending]]
=== How sending is affected for imported contacts

All imported contacts will be reviewed by our Compliance team before
they can be sent to and the first 3-5 Campaigns sent to newly imported
contacts will also be reviewed by Sendlane's compliance team.

The initial List Review generally takes 24 business hours.¬†Sendlane's
compliance¬†team reviews imports from 9AM to 5 PM PST, Monday through
Friday.

During List Review, you may see the following statuses next to your
Import:

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]

* *Processing* - The List is being processed and is in queue to be
reviewed by the Compliance team
* *Active* - The List has been processed, reviewed by our Compliance
team, and is now being activated in your account
* *Completed* - The List is finished activating and is now ready to send
to!

|===

During List Review, the Sendlane compliance team will review 3-5
Campaigns before they are sent to confirm the health of your list.
You'll see a red flag next to a Campaign that is currently being
reviewed, and you'll receive an email to the account holder's email
address about the status of your Campaign.

==== Contact import tool

Once your file loads, you'll see options to map your file's fields to
standard or custom fields.¬†Columns for standard fields (email, first
name, last name, phone number, email consent*, and SMS consent) should
map automatically. Email and SMS consent fields may not map
automatically, ensure consent fields are mapped appropriately using the
guidance above.

Opt-in¬†details, like subscribed date, sign-up IP, and sign-up source,
are usually automatically set to "Ignore this field," but our import
tool may detect the column header. Select the correct field from the
dropdown if it is not set automatically.

To add a Tag to every contact in your file, enter the Tag in the Tags
field.

Check the permission checkbox to confirm that you have

=== Troubleshooting

[[email-issue]]
====== After importing I received an email saying "Uh-oh... There's an issue with your import!"

Import issues could be related to:

* File formatting: Review the file formatting note above and make sure
your import file is formatted correctly. If you've included columns for
non-required data, try removing those columns and attempting to upload
again.
* Plan issue: If you are on a free trial, you cannot import more than
100 contacts. If your import file contained more than 100 contacts, your
import will not be accepted.¬†
