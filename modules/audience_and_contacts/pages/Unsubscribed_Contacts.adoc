Keeping a record of unsubscribed contacts is one of the ways Sendlane
works to protect you as a sender. When Contacts are designated as
unsubscribed from a List in Sendlane, they cannot be added back to that
List.

Email regulations such as the
https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business[CAN-SPAM
act] and https://gdpr-info.eu[GDPR] require that all digital senders
honor the privacy of personal data and opt-out requests.

Sendlane is a fully permission-based platform and complies with all
email regulations. We require that every person on your list expressly
consents to being contacted by you, from the moment they subscribe, to
every email opened, to the moment they choose to unsubscribe.

[[protecting]]
=== Protecting Your Reputation

If a Contact who has unsubscribed from a List is accidentally added back
to the same List after their record is deleted from Sendlane, receiving
content that they explicitly do not want to receive might prompt them to
mark your content as spam. Spam complaints can cause deliverability and
sender reputation issues.

Customer journey data (including unsubscribed, or "opt-out requests")
is essential to keep on file, in case a Contact questions if their
privacy data was violated at any point by your account. 

We recommend keeping all customer journey data in Sendlane and not
removing unsubscribed Contacts. However, if you choose to delete
unsubscribed Contacts, it is important to keep copies of all customer
journey data.

=== Protecting Your Data

We do not recommend deleting unsubscribed Contacts for two important
reasons:

. Keeping customer journey data outside of your Sendlane account means
you are responsible for backing up that data.
. Removing unsubscribed Contacts from your Sendlane account removes all
data associated with the Contacts' profiles, including revenue data.

=== Troubleshooting

[[number]]
====== My number of unsubscribed Contacts isn't going down!

If you have followed the instructions above for unsubscribing Contacts
from Lists and aren't seeing your unsubscribe total go down, you may be
encountering a timeout error. Try selecting fewer Lists at a time while
removing unsubscribed Contacts.

[[sms-only]]
====== How do I unsubscribe a Contact only from SMS and keep the Contact's email subscription?

You cannot remove SMS consent from a Contact profile without also
removing email consent from within Sendlane. Contacts can reply STOP to
any SMS message from you to be unsubscribed from SMS and still receive
emails.
