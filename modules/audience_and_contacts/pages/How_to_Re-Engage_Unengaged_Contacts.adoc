Re-engaging Contacts who have stopped opening and clicking on your
emails is a challenge, and can hurt your sending reputation
substantially if not done carefully. Proceed with caution!

Sendlane suggests the following guidelines for re-engaging unengaged
Contacts:

[[combine]]
==== Send to Unengaged Contacts With Engaged Contacts

Sending to a segment of unengaged Contacts without a large group of
engaged Contacts will result in extremely poor open, click, and spam
metrics. Unengaged Contacts are not likely to open or click on links in
emails, and they are likely to mark your content as spam.

When sending a re-engagement Campaign, unengaged Contacts should account
for no more than 10% of the Campaign’s audience. For those sending to
smaller lists, unengaged Contacts should account for a maximum of 3-5%
of a re-engagement Campaign’s audience.

[[small]]
==== Send Multiple Small Re-Engagement Campaigns

Sendlane strongly recommends against sending a single, large Campaign
for the purpose of re-engagement. To minimize the risk to your sender
reputation, keep the audience for each re-engagement Campaign small.

This means sending multiple Campaigns over a period of time, depending
on the size of your overall audience and the proportion of unengaged
Contacts in your audience.

[[remove]]
==== Remove Remaining Unengaged Contacts After Re-Engagement

Contacts who have been sent a re-engagement Campaign and remain
unengaged should be removed from your audience for the health of your
sender reputation.

The following Segment can identify Contacts who have not engaged with
your content for a specified period of time:

* Engagement and Activity > Did Not Open > Recent> (Number of days since
beginning of re-engagement attempt), AND
* Contact Properties > Subscription Date > Is Before > (Date that is 1
month prior to the day running the segment)
