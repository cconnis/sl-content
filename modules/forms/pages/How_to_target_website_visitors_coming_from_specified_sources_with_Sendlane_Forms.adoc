=== Create UTM

Sendlane Forms requires a UTM for the source you want to target. Use a
URL builder, like
https://ga-dev-tools.google/ga4/campaign-url-builder/[Googleâ€™s], to
create a link with your chosen UTM codes appended.

Letâ€™s say you want to show your form to website visitors who click a
link youâ€™ve included in your brandâ€™s Instagram story.

To build a URL, you must specify a source and medium, and can optionally
specify a campaign name, term/keywords, and content. For our example we
will specify a source and a medium.

ðŸ’¡ Using fewer specifications means your link is more general purpose
and can be reused several times, but the data you collect will be broad.
Using more specifications means your link will generate more granular
data, but youâ€™ll need to create more links to meet your marketing
strategyâ€™s needs.

A URL that identifies website visitors as coming from an Instagram looks
like this:

....
https://www.example.com/?utm_source=instagram&utm_medium=story>
....
