==== Overview

Teasers, especially if they are set to display persistently, help
increase form submissions by reminding shoppers to fill out your main
form while they browse.

You can create a form teaser by adding a page to your form's design.
Teasers can be displayed persistently or before and/or after contacts
open or close your form.

[[logic]]
=== Show logic options

Note that when website visitors dismiss the teaser and main form via
close buttons without submitting the form, neither will appear again for
three days as long as the visitor remains cookied.

Select your preferred display logic in the Show section:

* *On page load before main form* - Teaser will load just after the page
loads. The teaser will not load again after the main form is
dismissed. +
 +
If a website visitor opens the main form via the teaser before the main
form's display conditions are met and closes the main form, the main
form will not display again, even if its display conditions are met
later in the same browsing session. +
 +
For example, say the main form is set to display after scrolling 50% of
the page. If a website visitor clicks the teaser and dismisses the main
form before scrolling to 50%, the main form will not display even if the
website visitor scrolls to 50% of the page.
* *After main form is closed* - Teaser will load only after a website
visitor closes the main form.
* *On page load before main form and after main form is closed* - Teaser
will display persistently regardless of website visitor interaction with
the main form.

[[design]]
=== Teaser design options

Note that text is the only content supported in teasers; it is not
possible to add a button, option selector, or image block to a teaser.

====== Style

You can select Circle to change your teaser from the default of
rectangular to circular.

The size of the teaser cannot be manually adjusted, but rectangular
teasers will increase in height to accommodate lengthy text.

====== Position

You can select any position for your teaser except the center. Teasers
in the right or left middle positions will rotate ninety degrees to
display vertically on either side of your website.

====== Spacing

Use the pixel boxes or sliders to adjust your teaser's horizontal and
vertical spacing.

====== Background

Select a color or image to use as your teaser's background.

====== Border

Check the border box to add a border to your teaser, then adjust the
border's color, style, and thickness.

====== Corner radius and shadow

Teasers default to no corner radius or shadow. Select an optional corner
radius or shadow if these elements further your design goals.

[[close]]
====== Close button

Check the Close Button checkbox to add a close button to your teaser.
Adjust the close button's location, position, size, stroke width, and
color. 

Check the icon background checkbox to add a background to your teaser's
close button, then select a color and corner radius for the background.

====== Text

Add text for your teaser and adjust its color, font family, font size
and weight, letter spacing, line height, style (underlined or italic),
alignment, and top and bottom margins.

[[reporting]]
=== Teaser reporting

Teasers themselves do not contribute to
https://help.sendlane.com/article/637-understanding-sendlane-form-reporting-and-metrics[form
reporting metrics]. An impression is recorded for your form only when
the main form is loaded.

You may see a spike in impressions when you add a teaser to an existing
live form because website visitors are clicking the teaser and therefore
loading the main form more frequently.

=== Troubleshooting

[[no-teaser-option]]
====== I don't see a teaser page option

Teaser pages are not available for inline forms. Please contact product
support if you do not see the teaser page option when designing a pop up
form.

[[dismiss]]
====== Someone dismissed the form and teaser via the close button and saw it sooner than three days afterward

If website visitors clear their cookies before the three day "timer"
expires, their history with your form is erased. Without the cookie,
their browser cannot know they had dismissed the form via the close
button. If they dismiss the form via the close button again, the "timer"
will restart.
