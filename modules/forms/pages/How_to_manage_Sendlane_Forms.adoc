[[preview]]
=== Preview a form

Preview a form to review the form's design, copy its installation code,
or go to the form's design page.

You must have visited the design page of the form builder in order for
the form's design to be previewable. If the preview icon doesn't appear
next to a form, open the form and click into the design page.

To preview a form, click the *preview icon* in the actions column:

[[delete]]
=== Delete a form

Deleted Sendlane Forms and their associated metrics cannot be retrieved.
We strongly recommend setting forms you no longer need to draft status
instead of deleting.

To delete a form:

. Click the *trash can icon* in the Actions column
. Click *Delete*
. If the form is live at the time of deletion, you may see another
prompt saying “This form may be live/in use currently, are you sure?”
Click *Delete* to permanently delete your form.
