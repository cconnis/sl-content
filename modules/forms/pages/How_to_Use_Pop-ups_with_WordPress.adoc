=== Before Getting Started 

You will first need to
https://help.sendlane.com/article/308-popups[create a pop-up] in your
Sendlane account. 

Also, be sure that you have _admin access_ for your self-hosted
WordPress site. 

====== Please Note

We recommend creating a *_Banner_* type pop-up form, as this form will
be shown on every page of your WordPress site.  

Having a Pop-up or Inline form on every page may be distracting for your
website's visitors.
