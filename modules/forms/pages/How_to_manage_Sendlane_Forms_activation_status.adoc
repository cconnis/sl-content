[[activate]]
=== Activate a form

When you set a form to “live,” it is activated and visible on your
website if the code has already been installed.

Live forms will remain visible on your website unless you deactivate the
form by setting it to draft status or scheduling an end date, or remove
the form’s code from your website.
