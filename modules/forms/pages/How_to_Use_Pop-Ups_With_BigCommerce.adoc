=== Troubleshooting

====== I don't see my Pop-Up on my BigCommerce storefront!

There are a few common issues (with super easy fixes) that can cause
your Pop-Up to not appear:

. *Remove all other form snippets*Â If you've installed other lead
generation forms on your BigCommerce storefront in the past, make sure
all snippets are removed! This is the most common reason you aren't
seeing your Sendlane Pop-Up.
. *You missed a Save or Publish button* To see your Pop-Up, make sure
you've clicked *Save HTML* and *Publish*.

If you still don't see your Pop-Up, reach out to your Customer Success
Manager or our 24/7 product support team!
