=== Determine what data you want to collect

The option selector is a great way to collect standardized data from
your Contacts and helps avoid the pitfalls of text field submissions
differing slightly in spelling or composition (e.g., ‚Äúblue,‚Äù ‚ÄúBlue,‚Äù and
‚Äúblu‚Äù answers to ‚ÄúWhat is your favorite color?‚Äù)

Before adding an option selector block to your form, consider what data
you want to collect. Review your existing Custom Fields to see if you
can use one you‚Äôre already using to collect data or if an additional
field is needed.

[[option-selector]]
=== Add an option selector block to your form

[[option-selector-identification]]
===== üö® Option selector blocks must be used with an email or phone field in order to save data to Contact Profiles

Without an email address or phone number to associate with a form
submission, data from an option selector block will be lost.

[[option-selector-limit]]
===== üö® Only one option selector block is allowed per form

The following collection options are available for option selector
blocks:

* Checkbox - Allow Contacts to select multiple options
* Radio Button - Display all options and allow Contacts to select one
only
* Dropdown - Allow Contacts to select one option from a dropdown

In the Option # fields, enter the option as you want it to appear to
website visitors. In the Property fields, enter the option as you want
it to appear in Contacts‚Äô profiles.¬†If you are using a Custom Field
already in use, check naming conventions that may already be in place
for your field data and use those options in the Property fields.

For example, let‚Äôs say you want to collect your Contacts‚Äô clothing
preferences. You could set up your option block like this:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|Option # |Property
|Women‚Äôs |women
|Men‚Äôs |men
|Children‚Äôs |kids
|===

so that the more colloquial format is shown to website visitors, but
your data is compact and clean on the back end.

[[view]]
=== View and use Contacts' preferences

Responses to option selector blocks will appear as Custom Fields in
Contacts' profiles. Let's say you've created a checkbox option selector
to collect your Contacts' favorite colors like this:

A Contact who selected Orange, Green, and Indigo will display those
selections in the Personalization section of their Contact profile under
the Favorite Color custom field:
