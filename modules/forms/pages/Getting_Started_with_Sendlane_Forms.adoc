[[identify]]
=== Identify your formâ€™s goal

Before getting started with your first form, develop a goal for your
form and a plan for how to achieve it. Forms can collect contact
information from website visitors for the first time or be designed to
collect additional information from your existing Contacts.

Keep forms as simple as possible to reduce barriers to completion for
your website visitors. Forms that have a busy design or too many fields
may discourage website visitors from taking the time to give you their
information.

[[create]]
=== 1. Create a Form

When you create a form, youâ€™ll be asked to give it a name that will be
visible only on the Forms page, select a form type, specify which
devices you want your form to appear on, and select a layout.

In this guide, weâ€™ll create a basic sign up form from start to finish.

To create a form:

. Click the *Forms* icon
. Click *Create Form*
. Enter a descriptive *name* for your form
. Select a *form type** - Pop Up forms are overlaid on your websiteâ€™s
content, while inline forms are embedded in your formâ€™s content
. Select the *device types* you want your form to appear on
. Select a *layout* for your form* - The regular layout displays your
form in the middle of the screen, and the partial layout displays the
form on the bottom section of the screen
. Click *Next*

*Learn more about form types and layouts in the

form options section of Understanding Sendlane Forms design and
customization options].

[[configure]]
=== 2. Configure your formâ€™s audience, opt-in, and display settings

The first page of the Sendlane Forms builder is where youâ€™ll determine
which Lists or Tags you want Contacts to be added to when they submit
your form, opt-in settings for your form, and what conditions should be
met to trigger your form to appear on your website.

==== Audience

image:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/65df722b0f2a4c04f24d9c0d/file-ZOHt88yeMi.png[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/65df722b0f2a4c04f24d9c0d/file-ZOHt88yeMi]

Use the Subscription List and Tags dropdowns to select Lists you want
Contacts to be added to or Tags you want applied to Contactsâ€™ profiles
when they submit your form.

Learn more about form Audience settings in the
https://help.sendlane.com/article/624-understanding-sendlane-forms-audience-opt-in-and-display-logic-settings#audience[audience
section of Understanding Sendlane Forms audience&#44; opt-in&#44; and
display logic settings].

Weâ€™ll select our Newsletter List for new Contacts and no Tags for our
example sign up form since this form is general purpose.

[[opt]]
==== Opt-In Settings

Email and SMS double opt-in settings are a great way to ensure that the
people filling out your form want to receive your content.

Turn on email and SMS double opt-in by clicking the checkboxes:

image:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/65dd1cb893e735297b4ecc02/file-aS06gN0G4m.png[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/65dd1cb893e735297b4ecc02/file-aS06gN0G4m]

Learn more about form opt-in settings in the
https://help.sendlane.com/article/624-understanding-sendlane-forms-audience-opt-in-and-display-logic-settings#opt-in[opt-in
settings section of Understanding Sendlane Forms audience&#44;
opt-in&#44; and display logic settings].

For our example sign up form, weâ€™ll turn on both email and SMS double
opt-in.

==== Displayimage:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/65dd1cca53788e77b07d4593/file-RgJqaHzH0l.png[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/65dd1cca53788e77b07d4593/file-RgJqaHzH0l]

Display options contain trigger, display, and targeting options. These
settings determine who sees your form and when they see it.

Learn more about form display settings in the
https://help.sendlane.com/article/624-understanding-sendlane-forms-audience-opt-in-and-display-logic-settings#display-targeting[display
targeting section of Understanding Sendlane Forms audience&#44;
opt-in&#44; and display logic settings]].

For our example sign up form, weâ€™ll leave *Show* options set to the
default of On any selected condition.

Because this is a general purpose sign up form where we want to collect
as many interested website visitors as possible, the only *Condition*
weâ€™ll select is Show X seconds after page load and set the seconds to 1.

Weâ€™ll also leave our *Device* selection as the Desktop & Mobile layout
we selected when we created our form.

Weâ€™ll set the *frequency* to Show on every visit so that website
visitors have multiple chances to complete the form.

We will not select any *targeting* or *location* options because we want
our form to appear in as many places as possible.

When youâ€™re satisfied with your formâ€™s audience, opt-in, and display
settings, click *Design* to move on to designing your formâ€™s look and
feel!

[[design]]
=== 3. Design your form

The second page of the Sendlane Forms builder is where youâ€™ll determine
the number of pages (steps) your form has, its styling, and its
elements.

[[arrange]]
==== Arrange pages

Letâ€™s start with our form pages. Since this is an initial sign up form,
weâ€™ll collect website visitorsâ€™ email addresses and phone numbers and
add a final confirmation page.

Use the pages bar in the top middle of the form builder to add new
pages, rearrange pages, or delete pages.

https://help.sendlane.com/article/625-understanding-sendlane-forms-design-and-customization-options#form-pages[pages

[[global]]
==== Set global styles

Although each element on your form can be individually styled, the
Global Styles tab allows you to set default styling for all elements at
once so you donâ€™t need to adjust each individual piece of your formâ€™s
styles.

Head to the Global Styles tab of the form builder and adjust your formâ€™s
style settings to match your brand. Global Styles will automatically be
applied to any new elements you add to your form.

Learn more about global styles in the
https://help.sendlane.com/article/625-understanding-sendlane-forms-design-and-customization-options#global-form-styles[global
form styles section of Understanding Sendlane Forms design and
customization options].

==== Adjust content

You can add images, text, fields, and buttons to your form on the
Content tab of the form builder.

Sendlane Forms content options] and design options in

Sendlane Forms design and customization options].

First, weâ€™ll replace the placeholder logo by clicking the image >
Replace:

Next, weâ€™ll edit the placeholder text elements by clicking the element
and making our desired changes, then weâ€™ll delete a placeholder text
element that we donâ€™t need.
image:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/65dd1d6489182269183fa56b/file-vKINRudOhX.gif[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/65dd1d6489182269183fa56b/file-vKINRudOhX]

Our email page looks pretty good so far! Next, weâ€™ll check the settings
for our button and update its font.

The button is set to Submit and go to next page, which means that when
website visitors enter their email and click NEXT, the email address is
sent to Sendlane. If visitors donâ€™t complete the next page of the form,
the email address will still be captured.
image:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/65dd1d981c2f8d3d7ebfd56d/file-sXmWuJSfRw.gif[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/65dd1d981c2f8d3d7ebfd56d/file-sXmWuJSfRw]

Now that our email page is ready, weâ€™ll click the SMS and Confirmation
pages to adjust content and styling before moving on.

When youâ€™re satisfied with your formâ€™s pages, click *Summary* to
activate your form!
