[[opt-in]]
=== Set a form‚Äôs opt-in settings

You can turn on double opt-in for email, SMS, or both for any Sendlane
Form.

When email double opt-in is turned on, website visitors who fill out
your form will receive an email containing a link that leads to a
subscription confirmation page. You will ¬†select a Sender Profile that
double opt-in emails are sent from. Contacts will need to click the link
and confirm their subscription to grant permission to receive emails
from you.

When SMS double opt-in is turned on, people who fill out your form will
receive an SMS message asking them to reply Y. Contacts will need to
reply Y to grant permission to receive SMS messages from you. SMS double
opt-in is highly recommended to prevent false opt-ins.

[[opt-in-language]]
===== ‚ö†Ô∏è If double opt-in is turned on, include information on your form about how to confirm subscription

your messages

https://help.sendlane.com/article/639-how-to-open-a-sendlane-form-programmatically-and-listen-to-sendlane-form-activity-events[custom

You can show your form to contacts based on their subscription status or
presence/absence on a list, segment, or tag:

. *Show to all visitors* - Form will appear to any website visitor
. *Show to any existing contact* - Form will appear to any website
visitor who is subscribed to your email or SMS channels
. *Show to email subscribers only* - Form will appear to any website
visitor who is subscribed to your email channel
. *Show to SMS subscribers only* - Form will appear to any website
visitor who is subscribed to your SMS channel
. *Show to contact based on a list, segment, or tag* - Form will appear
to any website visitor who is or is not on the selected list, meets or
does not meet the criteria of the selected segment, or has or does not
have the selected tag applied to their contact profile
. *Don't show to existing Sendlane Contacts* - Form will appear to any
website visitor who is NOT subscribed to your email or SMS channels

[[visitor-cookie-status]]
===== ‚ö†Ô∏è Contacts must meet the above criteria _and_ be cookied in order to see the form

For conditions 2-5, contacts must both meet the selected criteria and be
cookied for the form to display. Contacts are cookied when they are
opted into your content, and have received an email from you, and have
clicked on a link in an email from you.

If contacts meet the conditions but have cleared their cookies without
being cookied again before visiting the website, they will not see the
form.

[[segment-refresh-rates]]
===== ‚ö†Ô∏è Segment re-processing times affect form visibility

Contacts' presence or absence on a segment can depend on the segment's
last processing time. The first page of segments plus any segments in
the "send to" section of a Campaign sent in the past three months are
re-processed when any user logs in to your Sendlane account.

For example, let's say you want to use a purchasers segment to exclude
existing purchasers from seeing your form because it contains a coupon.
The existing purchasers segment processes when you log into your
Sendlane account at noon. Your contact Jimmy, who has never made a
purchase, visits your site at 12:05 and sees the form containing a
coupon. Jimmy completes a purchase at 12:15 and can still see the coupon
form because, even though he just completed a purchase, the segment
hasn't re-processed since noon.
