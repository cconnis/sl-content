[[available]]
=== Available CSS selectors

The CSS example below shows all available selectors for Sendlane forms.
The screenshot below the CSS shows the effects of the sample CSS on a
Sendlane form.

Use https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp[w3's CSS reference guide]
for information on styles to apply to your form. Then, try copying the
snippet below into the custom CSS box of your own form and replacing the
values to see how the CSS changes your form!

....
/* Text elements */
.form-element__text-element {
    color: #ff3c78;
}

/* Image elements */
img {
    width: 100%;
}

/* Each element in the email is a row; enter target row number in parentheses */
.form-element:nth-child(1) {
    background-color: #FFFFFF;
}
.form-element:nth-child(5) {
    background-color: #ffc828;
}

/* Field text input */
input {
    color: #373737;
}

/* Option selector label */
label.slf-questionnaire__item{
      color: blue;
}

/* Dropdown */
select {
    color: #ff3c78;
}

/* Button text */
.slf-button {
    color: #e9f3ff;
}

/* Close/x button */
.slf-widget__close-button {
    background-color: #ffc828;
}

.legal-text {
  line-height: 12px;
}

/* Class to target specific page; replace 1 with desired page */
.slf-form--page-2 {
    background-color: white;
}

/* Stack classes in one line separated by a space to target an element (e.g., button) on a specified page */
.slf-form--page-2 .slf-button {
    color: #ff3c78;
}
....

[[target-page]]
=== How to target a specific page

You can target a specific page of your form with custom CSS to apply a
single style to one page only by using the `+.slf-form--page-1+` class
and replacing `+1+` with whichever page you want to target.

Let's say you want each page of your form to have a different
background, like this:

image:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/666393661f3fa9421e287b9c/file-AWMHC6IAEO.png[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/666393661f3fa9421e287b9c/file-AWMHC6IAEO]You
can use the following snippet to achieve the yellow, blue, and green
pages above by changing the `+background-color+` values to your
preferred colors (see more information on adjusting backgrounds with CSS
https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_background.asp[here]):

....
.slf-form--page-1  {
    background-color:#FDF2D0;

}

.slf-form--page-2  {
    background-color: #D3E2F1;

}

.slf-form--page-3  {
    background-color: #DCFFE4;

}
....

Use  `+.slf-form--page-[PAGE NUMBER]+` v

link:#top[Back to top]

'''''

[[target-element]]
=== How to target a specific element

You can use stacked classes to target a specified element on a specified
page. Use the  `+.slf-form--page-[PAGE NUMBER]+` class to specify the
form page (replace `+[PAGE NUMBER]+` with the number of the page you'd
like to target), then add a space and an element selector,
like `+.slf-button+` or another element link:#available[listed above].

In the example below, only the button on the second page of the form is
targeted:

image:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/6668a59e5173914f806c1a5d/file-ZFjadVO20j.png[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/6668a59e5173914f806c1a5d/file-ZFjadVO20j]

You can use the following snippet to single out an element by replacing 
`+[PAGE NUMBER]+` in `+.slf-form--page-[PAGE NUMBER]+` with the number
of the page you'd like to target, add a space, then
change `+.slf-button+` to the element selector you'd like to target:

....
.slf-form--page-2 .slf-button {
  background-image: linear-gradient(pink, purple);
}
....

'''''

[[target-position]]
=== How to target a specific position

Targeting by position is helpful when you have two of the same elements
on a page, like a button, and want to change the styling for just one.
Each element in your form has a sequential position that starts at the
top (the first element) and ends at the bottom (the last element). You
can target elements using their position on your form instead of the
element name.

To determine the position you want to target, count the elements in your
form starting at the top:

image:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/6668b600dd0f8c60bb3fcfc1/file-LqLXgi421Z.png[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/6668b600dd0f8c60bb3fcfc1/file-LqLXgi421Z]

You can target the position you want by adding a 
`+.form-element:nth-child(POSITION NUMBER)+` class before the element
you want to change (replace `+POSITION NUMBER+` with a number). The
following snippet will make the second button in the form above green
instead of blue:

....
.slf-form--page-1 .form-element:nth-child(5) .slf-button {
  background-color: green;
}
....

image:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/6668bb1a5940934e140f49c9/file-IpU2D9rgk1.png[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/6668bb1a5940934e140f49c9/file-IpU2D9rgk1]

[[stack]]
=== How to stack classes and target by multiple attributes

You can target multiple attributes by stacking classes from page >
position > element. You must use that order whenever stacking classes
and separate each class with one space.

The snippet below targets both buttons on page 2 of a form:

....
.slf-form--page-2 .form-element:nth-child(6) .slf-button {
  background-image: linear-gradient(orange, red);
}

.slf-form--page-2 .form-element:nth-child(7) .slf-button {
  background-image: linear-gradient(gray, black);
}
....

image:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/6668bf87d593d719515ca6a4/file-4YBjdQMXRF.png[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/6668bf87d593d719515ca6a4/file-4YBjdQMXRF]

link:#top[Back to top]

'''''

[[gradient]]
=== How to apply a gradient to buttons

You can use gradients to create smooth transitions between two or more
colors in your form buttons. See examples below:

image:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/6668c1f0d593d719515ca6a8/file-tMPh2tbH2g.png[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/6668c1f0d593d719515ca6a8/file-tMPh2tbH2g]

....
.slf-button {
  background-image: linear-gradient(pink, purple);
}
....

image:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/6668c1f51f3fa9421e287d64/file-agmclfrJEW.png[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/6668c1f51f3fa9421e287d64/file-agmclfrJEW]

....
.slf-button {
  background-image: linear-gradient(
    104deg,
    rgba(253, 81, 100, 1),
    rgba(36, 208, 235, 1)
  );
}
....

 For more information on gradients, check out
https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_gradients.asp[w3's guide to CSS
gradients] and experiment with your forms.

[[wrap]]
=== How to wrap option selector block selections

If you use an option selector block with many options, you may want to
wrap your options so that they appear more compactly in your form and
are easier to scan.

You can use and adjust the following snippet to turn your option
selectors into "buttons" that are grouped together:

image:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/6668c29add0f8c60bb3fcfd3/file-N4kr48pChs.png[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/6668c29add0f8c60bb3fcfd3/file-N4kr48pChs]

We suggest not editing the `+.slf-questionnaire+` section or checkbox
squares unless you are familiar with CSS. In the
`+.slf-questionnaire__item+` section, Edit the
https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_border.asp[border] and
https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_background.asp[background-color] to
match your brand's styling.

....
/* Make options wrap around */
.slf-questionnaire {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  gap: 8px;
  max-width: 600px;
}

/* Add border to each option */
.slf-questionnaire__item {
  border: solid 1px black;
  background-color: white;
  border-radius: 4px;
  padding: 6px;
}

/* Make the checkbox square bigger */
    input[type="checkbox"] {
      width: 15px;
  height: 15px;
  margin: auto 0px;
}
....

[[option-button]]
=== How to make radio and checkbox style option selectors look like buttons

You can make radio and checkbox style option selectors look like buttons
instead of radio buttons and dropdowns so that selections are
highlighted when clicked. See examples below, and see the comments in
the snippets (text surrounded by /* and */) for clarification:

[[radio]]
===== Radio style

Use a radio style option selector if you want website visitors to be
able to select just one option.
