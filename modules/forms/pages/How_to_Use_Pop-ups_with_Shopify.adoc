. ClickÂ *Themes*Â 
. ClickÂ *Customize*
. ****Click *Add Section* where you want your inline form to appear
. Select *Custom Liquid*Â

=== Troubleshooting

[[theme-variation]]
====== My theme doesn't have the recommended file to place the Pop-up code!

Because themes vary widely, you may have to experiment with placement.
If you already use another Pop-up or form product, try placing the code
in the exact same spot your existing forms were installed in. Reach out
to the support team of the theme you're using for the most accurate
advice on where to place third party snippets!
