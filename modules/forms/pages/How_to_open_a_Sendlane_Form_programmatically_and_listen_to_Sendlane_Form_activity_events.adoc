==== Overview

You can create custom triggers for your Sendlane Form enabling you to
open a form programmatically with JavaScript. We also provide the
ability to listen to form activity events, enabling you to be notified
when a user has taken actions related to the form using JavaScript.

[[find]]
=== How to find a Sendlane Form’s key

To create a custom trigger for a Sendlane Form, you will need the form’s
key in its installation code. To find a Sendlane Form’s key:

. Open the form
. Click Design
. Click Summary
. In the left sidebar, locate the Form Installation Code
. In the Form Installation Code window, copy the value inside the
quotation marks for `+form_key+`
+

[[events]]
=== Form events

Sendlane Forms send an event called `+sendlaneForms+` to the window each
time activity occurs on a form. The Sendlane form event gets dispatched
like the following code example. See the object for a sample event
payload:

....
const event = new CustomEvent("sendlaneForms", {
    detail: {
        type: 'submit',
        form_key: 'ENTER_FORM_KEY_HERE',
        metaData: { 
            email: 'test@example.com',
            // additional fields 
        }   
    }
});
window.dispatchEvent(event);
....

===== ⚠️ `+ENTER_FORM_KEY_HERE+` must be replaced with your form’s unique form key, found in the form installation code on the summary page of the form builder

The following event types are available for Sendlane Forms:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|Event |Description
|`+form_ready+` |This event fires when an embedded form loads on a page

|`+open+` |This event fires when a form initially displays on a page

|`+close+` |This event fires when a visitor closes a form

|`+step_submit+` |This event fires when each step is submitted, and it
can fire multiple times per form

|`+submit+` |This event fires when a visitor submits the main conversion
action of a form (e.g., the first email or SMS subscription action), and
will only fire once per form

[[listener]]
=== Form event listener structure

See the example below for the general structure of custom event
listeners for form events.

The field `+open+` can be changed to any other form event type listed in
the table above.

Replace `+Custom JS+` with the JavaScript that should run when the event
occurs.

....
<script>
    window.addEventListener("sendlaneForms", function(e) { 
        if (e.detail.type == 'open') {
            // Custom JS
        }
    });
</script>
....

[[setup]]
=== Custom form trigger setup

You can create custom triggers for your form by:

. Selecting “Only on custom trigger condition” for your form’s
https://help.sendlane.com/article/624-understanding-sendlane-forms-audience-opt-in-and-display-logic-settings#show[show
options]
. Implementing the pusher.js library in your website’s code
.. The pusher.js library is highlighted in each form installation code
window as shown below. This script can cause issues if it is installed
more than once on your
site.image:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/65eb9f59859b696e0f4340a0/file-T62SS7mjun.png[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/65eb9f59859b696e0f4340a0/file-T62SS7mjun]
. Using the library to trigger the `+_Sendlane.openForm("form_key")+`
function when your custom condition is met

[[only-custom-trigger-show-option]]
===== ⚠️ Custom triggers will only work if “Only on custom trigger condition” is selected for your form’s show options.

You cannot select another show option and also implement a custom
trigger.

Your custom trigger can include whatever parameters you’d like, such as
only showing for certain visitors, on certain days, or when a button is
clicked.

Let’s say you’d like to trigger your form to display when a button is
clicked. First, you'll need to paste your form's installation code into
your website. Then, you'll build your custom trigger by adding an 
`+onclick+` attribute to a button.

If you have an existing button you’d like to use to trigger a form,
insert the following `+onclick+` attribute into your existing button
element: `+onclick="_Sendlane.openForm('form_key')"+`

If you don’t have an existing button you want to use, you can use the
following structure to create a button that opens a specified form:

....
<button onclick="_Sendlane.openForm('form_key')">
    Open Form
</button>
....

Your file should look something like this:

....
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Document</title>
  
</head>
  
<body>
  <script>
window._Sendlane = window._Sendlane || [];
_Sendlane.push({
    form_key: "FORM_KEY"
});
</script>
<script src="https://sendlane.com/scripts/pusher.js" async></script>
  <h1>Form</h1>
  <button onclick="_Sendlane.openForm('FORM_KEY')">
    Open Form
</button>
</body>
</html>
....

[[form-reappearance]]
=== Form reappearance after submission

There is no mechanism in place that will stop a form from reappearing
after submission when your custom trigger conditions are met. If you
want to prevent your form from reappearing to website browsers who have
already submitted it, you will need to build those conditions into your
form.
