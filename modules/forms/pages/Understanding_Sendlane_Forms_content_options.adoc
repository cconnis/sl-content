=== Text

Use the text block to insert text into your form, such as an attention
grabbing headline, a call to action, instructions, or other relevant
information. Try to keep text on forms concise and to the point so that
website visitors aren’t dissuaded from signing up for your content by
having to spend too much time reading.

Dynamic content, personalization tags, coupon codes, and custom data
cannot be rendered in text blocks.

To add a text block, click the text Text icon:

[[option]]
=== Option Selector

Use the option selector block to insert a question or survey with
multiple answer options. The option selector is a great way to collect
standardized data from your Contacts and helps avoid the pitfalls of
text field submissions differing slightly in spelling or composition
(e.g., “blue,” “Blue,” and “blu” answers to “What is your favorite
color?”)

[[option-selector-identification]]
===== ⚠️ Option selector blocks must be used with an email or phone field in order to save data to Contact Profiles

Without an email address or phone number to associate with a form
submission, data from an option selector block will be lost.

[[option-selector-limit]]
===== ⚠️ Only one option selector block is allowed per form

The following collection options are available for option selector
blocks:

* Checkbox - Allow Contacts to select multiple options

* Radio Button - Display all options and allow Contacts to select one
only

* Dropdown - Allow Contacts to select one option from a dropdown

In the Option # fields, enter the option as you want it to appear to
website visitors. In the Property fields, enter the option as you want
it to appear in Contacts’ profiles.

For example, let’s say you want to collect your Contacts’ clothing
preferences. You could set up your option block like:

[cols=",",]
|===
|*Option #* |*Property*
|Women’s |women
|Men’s |men
|Children’s |kids
|===

so that the more colloquial format is shown to website visitors but your
data is compact and clean on the back end.
