Auto-upgrade protection is now in place for all Sendlane accounts to
prevent service disruptions caused by collecting more leads than your
current subscription accounts for. This is a fantastic service for
rapidly-growing contact lists!

Rather than locking down sending or preventing new leads from being
added to your account, your subscription will be automatically upgraded
to the next available tier and you'll see the Auto Upgrade status
in  _Account_ → _Billing_ under the _Plan Details section:_

====== Please Note

We prorate all payments to be sure that your renewal date stays
consistent and predictable, so if auto-upgrade moves you to the next
plan, you'll _only_ be charged for the current subscription period
today. Your account will renew on the new plan going forward.

If you decide to _downgrade_ to a smaller plan size in the future,
please be sure your contact count drops below the threshold for the plan
you'd like to move to, and stays there even if you continue collecting
new leads.
