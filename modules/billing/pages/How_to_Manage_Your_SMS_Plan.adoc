==== Overview

Your SMS monthly or annual subscription will auto-upgrade your plan if
you have a standard/non-custom auto-upgrade protection enabled and
attempt a send that requires more SMS credits than you have available in
your account. Charges are always pro-rated based on the day of the
auto-upgrade.

You can manually adjust your SMS plan anytime to fit your marketing
strategy's needs! When you upgrade your SMS plan to a higher tier, any
remaining credits in your account will roll over into your new billing
period.

The number of credits used per Campaign or Automation SMS depends on the
content of the message and the number of Contacts the message is sent
to. Review

===== ⚠️ Canceled plans permanently release toll-free numbers

After plan cancellation or payment failure, you must warm up a new toll-free number to reactivate your Sendlane SMS plan.
This process includes notifying existing Contacts of your new phone number and limiting sending for a period of time.

Please ensure your payment information is current to avoid failed payments, and use the process outlined below to change your SMS plan.

=== Auto-upgrade protection and cost per credit charges

You have two options available for times when you need to send an SMS
message and don't have enough credits: automatically upgrading to the
next SMS plan level (auto-upgrade protection) or paying cost per credit
(CPC) overage charges.

Auto-upgrade protection automatically moves your account to the next
highest plan if you attempt to send a Campaign that requires more
credits than are available in your account.

Cost per credit coverage charges the payment method on file for your
full plan amount when your available credits reach 10% of your plan. For
example, if you have 1,000,000 credits and CPC selected, your payment
method will be charged if your credits deplete to 100,000.

To adjust your SMS billing options:

. Click the *Account* icon
. Click *Billing* 
. Click *SMS Plans*
. Under the overview of your SMS plan, select *Upgrade to next plan* or
*Pay CPC overage*
