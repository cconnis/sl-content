==== Sending Credits

Sendlane's email plans are based on sending volume and provide a set
number of sending credits for your billing period.

If you're moving to Sendlane from another email service provider we
recommend selecting a plan that provides at least enough sending credits
to continue sending at your current volume.

Check out the resources below for common former ESPs to determine your
email volume:

=== Auto-Upgrade Protection

If you attempt to send an email using more credits than are available in
your account and you have auto-upgrade protection turned on, your plan
will be auto-upgraded to the next plan level. You can also choose to pay
CPM overages, which charge a fee per credit when attempting to send
without enough sending credits in your account.

Use the radio buttons underneath your email plan details to choose
Upgrade to next plan or Pay CPM overage:
