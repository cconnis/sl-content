Before canceling your email subscription, consider putting your
accountÂ on hold or changing your plan to fit your needs.

OurÂ On HoldÂ plan is a great option if you want to take a break from the
email marketing world. We will keep all of your hard work and data safe
and ready for you when you decide to return!

If you choose toÂ put your account on hold, your saved billing
information will be used to charge your account a flat fee of $19 per
month until you reactivate your account. This option saves all of your
Contacts, Lists, Campaigns, and Automations, and all associated data for
both email and SMS! It is not possible to put just email or just SMS on
hold.
