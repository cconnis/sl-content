[[find]]
=== Find integrations

You can find a list of integrations Sendlane supports in your account or
on the
https://partnerdirectory.sendlane.com/tech-partners#directoryApp[integrations
marketplace].

To view available integrations in your account:

. Click the *Account* icon
. Click *Integrations*
. Use the search bar or filters to find your integration

Most integrations are "third-party," meaning Sendlane doesn't control
them. These integrations generally require an API key for setup, and
sometimes, a Sendlane custom integration is used to access all features
like
https://help.sendlane.com/article/521-how-to-create-a-custom-api-call[event
tracking].

You'll find links to setup guides for third-party integrations in the
integration's card on the integrations page in Sendlane. If the
integration only requires an API key from Sendlane, the guide will
likely link to the integration creator's documentation. If the
integration requires additional work in Sendlane, it will likely link to
an article in this knowledge base.
