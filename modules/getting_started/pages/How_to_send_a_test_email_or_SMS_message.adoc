[[limits]]
=== Test limitations

Test sends do not function exactly like a live send and are intended
primarily to view email and SMS formatting as users will see it in their
inboxes. Test sends have the following limitations:

* The unsubscribe link in the email footer will take you back to your
Sendlane dashboard or the Sendlane login page, not to the update
subscriptions preferences page
* Personalization will populate with data from a randomly selected
Contact profile in your account, even if you send a test email to an
email address that has a Contact profile with the included
personalization completed
* Abandoned product blocks used for abandoned checkout or abandoned
browse automations will not populate because, in a test email, no
abandonment data has been collected by your website
* https://help.sendlane.com/article/553-review-request-automation#review-request-link[Review
request links] will not point to the review submission form
* https://help.sendlane.com/article/565-how-to-create-and-share-a-contact-card[Contact
cards] sent via test message may render with special characters
