release] for commentary from the FTC and descriptions of prohibited
behavior, which include:

* Knowingly generating or disseminating (publishing) fake reviews or
testimonials written by AI or people who did not purchase or experience
the product
* Implicitly or explicitly providing compensation (cash, gifts, or any
other incentives) in exchange for reviews of a specific nature (positive
for your product or negative for competitors' products)
* Disseminating reviews or testimonials from your brand's management or
leadership and not complying with requirements for reviews disseminated
by your company's employees or their families
* Implicitly or explicitly stating that Sendlane generates reviews or
guarantees the independence or impartiality of your brand's reviews

accusations" to prevent customers from posting a review or convince them
to remove a negative review

* Buying or selling false social media metrics such as views, likes, or
follows

What you can do to stay compliant:

* Never publish, create, or solicit fake reviews
* Request reviews only from verified customers and use neutral language;
do not specifically ask for a positive review
* Do not offer incentives (like discounts or gifts) for positive
reviews, and do not ask customers to change negative reviews to positive
* Ensure reviews from your employees are clearly marked as such and
maintain clear disclosure policies for employees
* Moderate reviews consistently; do not suppress negative reviews solely
because they are negative

Sendlane Reviews contains built-in compliance tools, like autopublishing
pending reviews after 14 days regardless of star rating, but you are
ultimately responsible for ensuring your use of Sendlane Reviews follows
all applicable laws and regulations. Contact your legal team for further
