[[create-account]]
=== Create a Sendlane Account

If you haven't already signed up, head over the
https://sendlane.com/pricing[Sendlane site], choose the plan that works
best for you (or, select our
https://help.sendlane.com/article/197-free-14-day-trial[free 14-day
trial]) and register!

====== Please Note

You do need to have a fully functional
https://help.sendlane.com/article/108-business-website-company-email[_business_
email address] to register with Sendlane. If you cannot send and receive
emails via the email address you used to register, you cannot complete
the verification process to create your account.

'''''

[[activate]]
=== Activate/Verify Your New Account

Keep an eye on your inbox because once you register, we'll be sending
you an email to verify your account details with the subject line
*"Final Step: Confirm Your Account"*.

When you receive our activation/verification email simply click the pink
button in the email that says _*Activate
Account*._image:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5d2dfffa042863478674f6e8/file-6519rLHR0O.png[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5d2dfffa042863478674f6e8/file-6519rLHR0O]

====== Please Note

Be sure to check all inbox folders in the email account you used to
register for Sendlane. You cannot access your new Sendlane account until
you click on the button in your activation/verification email.

Then, the final step of the activation process is a short survey about
you and your business. Once you've answered a few quick questions, your
account will be fully activated and ready to go!

Next, we'll complete the onboarding survey for your account.

[[basics]]
=== Complete Your Onboarding Survey

The first thing you'll see after activating your Sendlane account is
your *Onboarding Survey*.

This survey was designed to help customize your Sendlane experience with
the most relevant tools and features for your business.

All you have to do is answer a few quick questions about your company,
your sender info, and your eCommerce Store - _if you have one!_

On the *_Your Sender Info_* page, you cannot use a free email account
such as Gmail, Yahoo, or Hotmail for your _From Email_.

We are compliant with current data processing and privacy regulations
which require all marketing emails to be sent from a paid, custom domain
email address.
