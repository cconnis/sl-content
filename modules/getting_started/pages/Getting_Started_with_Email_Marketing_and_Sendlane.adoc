Welcome to Sendlane; we‚Äôre thrilled to meet you! This guide will show
you how to set your Sendlane account up for success with email marketing
while safely warming your sending infrastructure.

Our https://www.sendlane.com/deliverability[world-class&#44; in-house
deliverability experts] recommend following the steps in this guide in
the order they appear to maximize your deliverability from the start!

[[bgs]]
===== üö¶ Before getting started

Once you‚Äôve https://auth.sendlane.com/register[signed up for Sendlane],
make sure you also have access to the following:

Your previous ESP, and

Your business website‚Äôs DNS settings

An email address that uses your company's business domain and is not
role-based (like sales@yourdomain.com). Role-based email addresses do
not necessarily belong to one person and cannot meaningfully consent to
marketing messages.

[[gather-metrics-contacts]]
=== Gather metrics and contacts from your previous provider

When you migrate to Sendlane you'll be starting fresh with important
metrics like open rates and click rates. You'll need to note your
baseline performance from your previous email provider, and segment
contacts by engagement data that lives in your previous email provider
before importing Contacts into Sendlane.

1

[[note-metrics]]
==== ¬† Note your baseline performance metrics

Log in to your previous email provider and record the metrics you
achieved for subscriber volume, open, click, and conversion rates. Keep
this information somewhere safe! Your baseline metrics can be used to
help diagnose deliverability issues in the future.

Open and click rates will vary during warm up. After enough clean
sending, generally one month, metrics should stabilize.

When your account is fully warmed, you should see metrics that meet or
exceed the baseline from your previous ESP!

[[attribution-window-update]]
===== ‚ö†Ô∏è Update the conversion or attribution window to equal last click in a five day window before noting conversion rates

Email service providers use varying calculations for assigning revenue
attribution or conversion. To best understand how your performance
compares in Sendlane to your previous provider, update your attribution
settings to last click in a five day window to match Sendlane's
attribution reporting before you record attribution or conversion
metrics. Using multiple different calculations for attribution means you
cannot make meaningful inferences about performance.

2

[[segment-export]]
==== ¬† Segment and export contacts from previous provider

[[remove-inactives]]
===== Create segments for and remove inactive contacts

Inactive Contacts and invalid emails will hurt your new sending
reputation and could lead to long-term damage to your sending
infrastructure.¬†When email addresses go unused, they can be turned into
spam traps. Sending an email to a spam trap can cause severe problems
for your business‚Äô sending reputation and deliverability. Sendlane
recommends removing Contacts who have not engaged with your content in
120 days.

Create a segment for Contacts who meet the following criteria:¬†Has been
on your list for at least 120 days, AND has been sent at least one email
in the past 120 days, AND has NOT opened an email from you in the past
120 days.

Remove these contacts from your main list and do not upload these
contacts into Sendlane.

[[segment-actives]]
===== Create segments for and export active contacts

In your previous email provider create segments using the following
logic for 30, 60, and 90 day periods:¬†Has been on your list for the past
X days AND has been sent at least one email in the past X days AND has
clicked on at least one email in the past 30 days

Export each of these segments separately in addition to your main list.
You should now have four .CSV files to import into Sendlane!

3

[[import-exported-contacts]]
==== ¬†Create engagement segments in Sendlane and import contacts

Once your Contacts are imported, you'll send Campaigns to your most
engaged Contacts to slowly warm up your sending infrastructure. Create
these segments now so they are ready when you need them, then import
your Contacts!

[[new-segments]]
===== Create high-engagement segments

https://help.sendlane.com/article/137-segments[Create segments]
identifying your Contacts' engagement over the last 30, 60, and 90 days.
For each period of time, create a segment using the following logic: has
been on your list for at least the past X¬†days, AND has¬†been sent at
least one email in the past X¬†days,¬†AND has¬†clicked on at least one
email in the past X¬†days.

[[compliance]]
===== ‚ö†Ô∏è Imports are reviewed during business hours

New Contact imports will be reviewed by Sendlane‚Äôs compliance team
during business hours of 8 AM to 4 PM PST, Monday through Friday. You
will receive an email when your import is accepted!

[[stop-sending-previous]]
=== Stop sending email from previous email provider

To maintain good deliverability and a positive sender reputation,
determine a point in time when your business will stop collecting leads
and sending emails with your previous ESP. Sending emails from two ESPs
simultaneously can cause ongoing deliverability issues and permanently
damage your business‚Äô sending reputation.

Let the high-engagement Automations you‚Äôve created run for 1-3 days, and
you‚Äôll be ready to start sending Campaigns to newly engaged Contacts.
Check out our
