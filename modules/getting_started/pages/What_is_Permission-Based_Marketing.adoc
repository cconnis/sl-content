Permission-based marketing is the practice of sending marketing
communications only to contacts who have given their _consent_ to
receive them. (That's why you might have also heard this referred to as
consent-based marketing.)

Sendlane is a 100% permission-based platform, so it's important to
clarify exactly what qualifies as permission-based, and how it relates
to collecting contacts as a Sendlane user!

[[vs]]
=== Implicit vs Explicit Permission

In terms of email marketing compliance, let's break down the types of
permission that exist:

* *_Implicit Permission_* is obtained through a customer or client
relationship, such as an in-person meeting or attending a webinar.
* *_Explicit Permission_* is obtained through a direct request, opt-in,
or purchase, like registering for a newsletter, submitting a contact
form on a website, subscribing on a landing page, clicking to agree to
marketing communications during a checkout process, etc. 

====== Please Note

Since Sendlane is

https://help.sendlane.com/article/115-gdpr-and-sendlane[GDPR], and
https://help.sendlane.com/article/401-ccpa-and-sendlane[CCPA] compliant,
we require that all of our users obtain _explicit_** **permission to
send marketing messages to each contact on their list.

=== How to Make Sure Your Lead Collection Process is Permission-Based

Explicit permission can be obtained using an
https://partners.sendlane.com/integrations/[integration], a custom
set-up via our https://help.sendlane.com/article/83-api-docs[API] or
even using a Sendlane

Explicit permission isn’t just for  _new_ contacts either. It’s
for _all_ contacts - even contacts you add
https://help.sendlane.com/article/128-how-do-i-add-contacts-to-my-account#manual[manually]
or via an
https://help.sendlane.com/article/128-how-do-i-add-contacts-to-my-account#import[import]. 

So before you add anyone to your account, be sure that each and every
contact has given you permission to send them messages.

====== Please Note

When _importing_ contacts you'll need to make sure opt-in details (like
IP address, date/timestamp, or location and sign-up source) are included
in your file, otherwise, our Compliance Team won't be able to approve
the import.

=== Permission-Based Best Practices 

Above and beyond getting clear consent from each contact, you should
also clarify important details about what they can expect from you after
opting-in.

Be specific about what you are offering and how often your contacts will
receive emails. If it’s a newsletter, it should be clear if it’s weekly,
monthly, or bi-monthly. If it’s a free download, they should know it’s
an immediate download via email. 

Making promises _and_ delivering on them is a good permission-based
marketing practice!
