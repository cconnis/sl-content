==== Overview

You can split a specified, random percentage of your automation audience
to A/B test two automation paths. Read on to learn how to use the
audience split node.

=== Add an audience split node

Once contacts reach the audience split, they cannot be moved from one
path to another. If the split percentage is changed after the automation
has been activated, existing contacts will stay on the path they started
on.

To create an audience split node:

. Click the *+ button*
. Click *audience split*
. Use the *slider* to determine the percentage of the automation's
audience to send down Side A and Side B
. Click *Done*
