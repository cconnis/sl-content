[[what-is-wait-node]]
=== What is a wait node?

Wait nodes act as buffers between automation nodes.

For example, let's say you're setting up a welcome automation with three
email nodes. Without a wait node between your email nodes, contacts will
receive all three emails in rapid succession right after meeting the
trigger criteria. However, if you include a wait node of one day between
the first and second email and another one day wait node between the
second and third email, contacts will receive email one on day one,
email two on day two, and email three on day three.

Remember that a contact's journey through automation is set when they
meets its trigger criteria. When contacts enter the example welcome
automation described above, they will not become "stuck" in a wait node;
the wait node adds the amount of time specified in its settings to the
contact's journey. An automation without wait nodes will schedule all
messages to be sent as soon as the contact meets the trigger's criteria,
while an automation with wait nodes adds the specified amount of time to
the sending schedule.

[[wait-timing-options]]
=== Wait node timing options

You can set a wait node to wait for a specified day of the week and
time. You can also set a specific time zone or select Recipient's Local
Time Zone from the Timezone dropdown.

For example, if you schedule your wait node to "end" at 9 AM your time
(EST), contacts will proceed to the next node at whatever time 9 AM EST
is in their time zone. If you schedule your wait node to "end" at 9 AM
recipients' local time, all contacts will proceed to the next node at 9
AM their local time.

Contacts' time zones are determined by the following attributes in the
following order:

. Combination of the ZIP code or province and country shown on the
contact profile
. Contact's phone number area code
. Contact's IP address (set by their latest click on a tracking link)
. Country on the contact profile (see default time zones per country
https://help.sendlane.com/article/693-default-time-zones-by-country?preview=66ad54f316e6a80d1e1d1fc4[here])

If none of the above attributes are available for a contact, the
campaign will be sent in the

local timezone].
