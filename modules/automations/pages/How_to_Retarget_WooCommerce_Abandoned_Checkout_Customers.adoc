any desired emails and wait times]
. Add a button and an abandoned checkout block to your email which will
link customers back to the abandoned cart
. Last but not least, don't forget to *Activate* the automation once
you're done building out your
funnelimage:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5ee258aa2c7d3a10cba8c537/file-NNSNQ7H5f4.png[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5ee258aa2c7d3a10cba8c537/file-NNSNQ7H5f4]

Now, when contacts are added to the abandoned checkout list they will
automatically start this automation!

[[cart-link]]
===== ðŸ’¡ Use the following snippet to add a direct link to Contacts' carts in hyperlinked text and images or custom buttons!

To place a direct link to a Contact's abandoned checkout in hyperlinked
text and images or a button, paste the following snippet in the URL
field:

`+{% set data = trigger.getCheckout() %} {{ data.checkout_data.cart_link }} +`

If Contacts click this link on a device other than the one they built
their checkout on, they will be taken to your store's generic cart page.

=== Troubleshooting

*Checkout was abandoned but the automation didn't trigger*

If you have noticed that a checkout has been abandoned but the
automation was not triggered, it is likely that the customer has not
clicked through to provide their contact information or did not agree to
receive promotional emails. Being a
https://help.sendlane.com/article/402-what-is-permission-based-marketing[permission-based
platform], the contact must have opted-in/agreed to receive promotional
emails during the checkout process.

====== The abandoned cart block isn't available!

The abandoned cart block may not appear in your elements sidebar for two
common reasons:

. Your eCommerce integration is not set up correctly. Review your
eCommerce store's integration with Sendlane for possible connection
issues.
. You already added an abandoned cart block to your email. Only one
abandoned cart block is allowed per email.
