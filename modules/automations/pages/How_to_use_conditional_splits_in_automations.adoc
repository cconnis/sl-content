[[understanding-logic]]
=== Understanding conditional splits

Conditional splits are automation nodes that function like segments. You
can use a conditional split to create logic based conditions that
determine which of two automation paths contacts should experience.

Conditional splits create divergent paths in automations based on
conditions like "has a specified product in their order" or "has a tag
for interested in X product."

For example, let's say you want to create two paths for your order
placed automation, depending on the products in the order. If contacts
have a certain item in their order, they should receive a special email.
Contacts who didn't order the specified item can proceed down the other
path that doesn't contain information about the specified product.

====== When do conditional splits check for the specified conditions?

When a contact meets an automation trigger's criteria, each action is
nearly instantly queued up. If there are no wait nodes before a
conditional split node, the conditional split checks the contact's
conditions as soon as they trigger the automation.

This almost instant check means that if a conditional split's logic
includes opened or clicked conditions, the split will immediately check
for those engagement metrics after messages are sent without enough time
for contacts to engage. Depending on the overall logic of your
automation, it often makes sense to add a 24-hour wait node before a
conditional split node that uses engagement-based conditions.

[[integration-conditions]]
====== A condition using an integration will only pull contacts who exist in the integration’s database into the YES side of a conditional split

Using an integration based condition in a conditional split will only
pull contacts who exist in the integration’s database into the YES side
of a conditional split. All contacts who do not exist in the
integration’s database will be sent down the NO side of a conditional
split, regardless of the conditions set.

Let’s say you want to create a conditional split that divides your
audience into contacts who have placed at least 1 order and contacts who
have placed 0 orders.

Your condition would be Customer > Total Orders Places > is greater than
> 0:

The YES side of this conditional split will grab contacts who exist in
your store’s database and have placed at least 1 order. The NO side will
grab contacts who do not yet exist in your store’s database (because
they haven’t made a purchase or an account on your store) AND contacts
who exist in your store’s database but have not yet placed an order.

[[add-split]]
=== Add a conditional split

To add a conditional split to your automation:

. Click the *+ button*
. ****Click *conditional split*
. Set your conditions
. Click *Done*

The conditions you select will funnel contacts who meet them down the
YES branch. Contacts who do not meet the conditions specified will be
sent down the NO branch.

[[flip]]
=== Flip YES and NO paths for a conditional split

You can flip the YES and NO paths for a conditional split to move
existing nodes from one branch to another.

Contacts who triggered the automation before you flipped the split will
receive all actions they were originally scheduled to receive; contacts
who triggered the automation after you flipped the split will be
scheduled to receive the new paths.

To flip a conditional split's branches:

. Click the *conditional split node*
. Click the *flip* icon
. Click *Flip Conditional Split*

[[options]]
=== Delete a conditional split

To delete a conditional split:

. Click the *conditional split*
. Click the *trash can* icon
. Select a path or both paths to delete
. Click *Delete*
