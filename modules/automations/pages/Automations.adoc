==== Overview

An Automation is a series of actions and communications triggered by a
Contact's behavior and preferences. Use an Automation when you want to
send evergreen content¬†based on Contacts' interactions with your brand!

With Automations, you can create the perfect email and SMS marketing
funnel to welcome new Contacts, nurture leads and customers, or even
update Contact Profiles‚Äîautomatically!

If you want to send¬†sale/special offer, date, or event-specific content
to your Contacts, check out our guide to
https://help.sendlane.com/article/153-campaigns[Campaigns].

[[components]]
=== Automation Components

Automations are made of four components or types of nodes: triggers,
actions, and logic and timing. Click on the name of each component below
to read our guides for each component type.

|===
|*Component* |*Description*

|https://help.sendlane.com/article/448-automation-triggers[Triggers]
|Triggers are user-based actions that start your Automation. Every
Automation needs at least one trigger to begin the next steps of
Automation.

|https://help.sendlane.com/article/449-automation-actions[Actions]
|Actions happen due to a trigger's conditions being met, such as sending
an SMS or email message, updating a Contact's profile, updating an
Automation, or passing information with a Webhook.

|https://help.sendlane.com/article/353-how-to-use-goals-and-conditional-splits-in-an-automation[Logic
and Timing] + |Wait times, Goals, Conditional Splits, and Audience
Splits allow you to use advanced targeting to send your Contacts highly
relevant content at the right time.

[[deactivate]]
=== Deactivate and Reactivate Automations

If Automations are deleted, they are gone forever, including content and
logic. To avoid losing the hard work you put into your Automations,
Deactivate them instead!

they are in the Automation
* *Reactivating* an Automation causes Contacts to pick up exactly where
they were when the Automation was deactivated

To deactivate an Automation:

. Click the *Stop icon* next to the Automation's name¬†
. Click¬†*Deactivate*

=== Delete an Automation

Deleting an Automation is permanent; there is no way to restore an
Automation once it is deleted. We recommend deactivating Automations
that you no longer need instead of deleting them.

If you decide to delete an Automation, click the trash can icon next to
the Automation you want to delete.

=== Troubleshooting

[[nodes]]
====== The add node button isn't working!

Automations have a limit of 50 nodes. If your Automation has less than
50 nodes and you can't add a new node, please contact your CSM or our
24/7 product support team!

[[not-starting]]
====== My Automation isn't starting!

Make sure your Automation is set to Active if it seems like your
Automation isn't starting when it should:

image:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5fac8bb14cedfd00165af7b6/file-PokYXSCrhe.png[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5fac8bb14cedfd00165af7b6/file-PokYXSCrhe]

[[not-sending]]
====== My Automation email isn't sending!

Make sure your Automation email is set to Active if Contacts are not
receiving emails from nodes they meet the conditions for:

image:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/61faea8ed86136157d9a0314/file-wOtgqilxin.png[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/61faea8ed86136157d9a0314/file-wOtgqilxin]

[[conditional-split]]
====== My Conditional Split isn't flowing!

Some Conditional Split actions have built-in required wait times between
actions. Review our
https://help.sendlane.com/article/353-how-to-use-goals-and-conditional-splits-in-an-automation#split[Conditional
Split guide] for detailed information!

[[infinite-loop]]
====== I'm getting an infinite loop error message!

Our Automation builder will prevent your Contacts from getting stuck in
"infinite loops," where one or more Automation sends a Contact back and
forth through a flow. Avoid this issue by creating new Automations with
fresh content for your audience to flow through to boost engagement and
avoid spam complaints!
