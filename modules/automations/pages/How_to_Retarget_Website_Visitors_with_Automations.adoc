Retargeting website visitors is a great way to keep your brand
top-of-mind even after contacts click away from your site.

By tracking the behavior of anyone who visits your website, you can
easily trigger an automation to follow up with every person via email,
and encourage them to convert!

a Conversion Rule and an Event to track].

====== Please Note

In order for Beacon to begin tracking the behavior of your audience,
contacts first need to opt-in to your account. 

Once they open a campaign that leads them back to your website, their
behavior will be tracked accordingly and available within their customer
profile!

. Select the event you previously created (in this example our event was
named _Site
Tracking_)image:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5e8fafab04286364bc9822b2/file-EYvfhgdiEW.png[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5e8fafab04286364bc9822b2/file-EYvfhgdiEW]
. Continue building your automation by adding any other
https://help.sendlane.com/article/73-automations#communications[actions
and communications] you'd like to use. Depending on what your goals and
objectives are, we recommend sending three emails over the next three
days to encourage contacts to come back and visit your website.
. Next, add a *Goal* action. We recommend checking to see if contacts
purchased! (So in this example, the goal conditions are that the contact
triggered the event by going back to the original URL _and_ have a
conversion amount greater than $1.00) +

. From here you can decide what happens next based on your overall
strategy! Select the next action once the goal is reached and what
happens if they do not reach the goal. You will also have the option to
select how many times the goal is checked before determining that it was
not met.
. Once you have completed your automation be sure to set the funnel
from _Inactive_ to *_Active_image:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5ee258aa2c7d3a10cba8c537/file-NNSNQ7H5f4.png[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5ee258aa2c7d3a10cba8c537/file-NNSNQ7H5f4]*

And that's it! 

Now, any contacts that visit your website will trigger this automation,
see your marketing emails and hopefully return to your website to make a
purchase!
