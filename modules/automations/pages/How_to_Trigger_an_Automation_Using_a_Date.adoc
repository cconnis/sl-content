===== ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip

Want to trigger an Automation leading up to _and_ on the same selected
date? Check out the link:#advance-on[instructions below]!
.. *Time* - Set the time (in the accountâ€™s timezone) for the Automation
to be triggered on the specified date
.. *Wait until the selected day(s) of the week* - Select this option to
only trigger the Automation on specified days of the week. Contacts
whose date field falls on a day that is not selected will trigger the
Automation on the first selected day after the date stored in the Custom
Field. +
 +
For example, if Contact A has 1/1/24 (a Monday) as the date in the
Custom Field and you select Tuesday and Thursday to trigger the
Automation, Contact A will trigger the Automation on Tuesday 1/2/24.
.. *Repeat Automation*:
... None - The Automation will not repeat
... Monthly - The Automation will repeat every month on the day stored
in the date field
... Yearly - The Automation will repeat every year on the day and month
stored in the date field

=== Send Messages In Advance of and on the Custom Field Date

Two Automations are required if youâ€™d like to send emails or SMS to
Contacts in advance of and on the date in their Date Field.

Letâ€™s say you want to send your Contacts a coupon to use before their
birthday, a reminder to use the coupon, and a message wishing them a
happy birthday on their birthday:

1::
  The Automation containing nodes that lead up to the Date Field should
  be set up first.
  +
  For our example, weâ€™ll send our Contacts a coupon two weeks before
  their birthday and a reminder to use the coupon one week before their
  birthday.
  +
  To create this Automation:
  +
  . Select the *Date Field* trigger
  . Under Start Automation, select *Before the date* and set the wait
  time to *2 Weeks*
  . Add an Email node and create an email that contains a coupon
  . Add a
  https://help.sendlane.com/article/353-how-to-use-goals-and-conditional-splits-in-an-automation#timing[Wait
  node] set to 1 week
  . Add another Email node and create an email that contains a reminder
  to use the coupon
  . Click Activate in the top right corner to activate your Automation!
  +
  The completed Automation should look like this:

  triggered on the date in the Contactâ€™s Date Field.
