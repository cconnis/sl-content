This tutorial will teach you how to move contacts from one list to
another using an Automation.

====== Please Note

This process only works for moving _new_ contacts that come in after the
automation is activated. If you'd like to move _existing_ contacts, they
will need to be moved manually using an export and import.

=== Before Getting Started

Before you can move contacts within your account, please be sure you
have a source list and a destination list created. 

Once https://help.sendlane.com/article/125-lists[both lists
are created], you can move on to setting up your automation!

https://help.sendlane.com/article/73-automations[**]

. Navigate to __*Automations* __→
https://help.sendlane.com/article/73-automations[New Automation]__ __and
select *Start from Scratch*
. Click to add a trigger, and choose *_Subscribes to a
list image:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5fe6464ef24ccf588e3fe8a9/file-ZUpaHRqA0Q.png[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5fe6464ef24ccf588e3fe8a9/file-ZUpaHRqA0Q]_*
. Select the source list that includes the contacts you'd like to move
and click *_Done_*
. Next, build out your automation with actions, emails, tags, and
anything else you might need
+
====== Please Note

One great reason to move contacts via an automation is to filter out
contacts who have engaged with your emails vs those who have not. This
can be done using a
https://help.sendlane.com/article/353-how-to-use-goals-and-conditional-splits-in-an-automation[conditional
split].
. Once you have your automation funnel built, select the conditional
split option from the actions toolbar.
. You will be able to set the rules for what you want the conditional
split to look like. This example will check if the subscriber opened any
campaign in the automation.

. Once you have the conditional split set up, add the *Update Contact
Property* action under the "Yes" or "No" branch, depending on your
preference__.  image:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5fe64704495a886ca7827e70/file-NhFrJTWoNE.png[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5fe64704495a886ca7827e70/file-NhFrJTWoNE]__**
. Click on *_Subscribe to List _*
. ****Select the destination list that you'd like contacts to move to
and click _Done._ Repeat steps 7-9 to fill out both sides of the
conditional split.   __

. If you'd like these contacts to remain on both lists, there's nothing
else for you to do. Once you activate your automation funnel, any new
contacts that subscribe to your source list will also be added to List
2.

If you'd like to unsubscribe contacts from your source list once they
join your destination list, please continue on to the section below for
next steps.

List image:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5fe64790f24ccf588e3fe8aa/file-91k2EksHzX.png[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5fe64790f24ccf588e3fe8aa/file-91k2EksHzX]* +

*_Done image:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5fe64d1c41fcb56e4047c0d4/file-BRD9bG8eJA.png[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5fe64d1c41fcb56e4047c0d4/file-BRD9bG8eJA]_*
. Toggle the automation status to
*Active. image:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5fe647aaf24ccf588e3fe8ab/file-UsKXNi8Y5f.png[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5fe647aaf24ccf588e3fe8ab/file-UsKXNi8Y5f]*

And you're all set! Any new contacts will be added to List 2 and
unsubscribed from List 1!

====== Please Note

The unsubscribe action (if it is unsubscribing the contact from the
source list [List 1]) will end the automation. Any action you place
after the unsubscribe action will not happen since the user is
unsubscribed from the source list.
