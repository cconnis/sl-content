===== 🚦 Before Getting Started

Create at least one list for new Contacts to be added to. We recommend
using one list for all new contacts and creating a separate newsletter
list for contacts to be added to once they complete the welcome
automation.

=== Background information for welcome automations

==== Welcome automation triggers

The automation trigger(s) you select for your welcome automation depends
on the methods you use to collect contacts’ information. The following
triggers are often used in welcome automations: +

* Subscribes to a List
* Submits a Form
* SMS Consent Received

Depending on your preferences and marketing programs, you can use
multiple triggers for a single welcome automation or multiple separate
welcome automations.

[[ sms-in-automations]]
==== SMS in welcome automations

In most circumstances, it’s best to use separate welcome flows for email
and SMS. We recommend using the SMS Consent Received trigger to start an
SMS specific welcome automation.

When contacts meet an automation trigger’s criteria, each node in the
automation is nearly instantly queued up for the contact. Let’s say you
have a welcome automation that uses the Subscribes to a List trigger
with the following nodes:

. Email
. Wait one day
. SMS
. Wait two days
. Email

As soon as the contact subscribes to the list specified in the trigger’s
settings, Sendlane generates a “schedule” for the contact based on the
information available at the time. 

If the contact hasn’t provided SMS consent before or during the sign up
process, the automation sees that the contact cannot receive SMS
messages and will skip the SMS message in node 3. The contact will never
receive that SMS message, even if they provide consent to receive SMS
before the SMS message is scheduled to send, because the schedule was
created before consent was given.

[[control]]
=== 2. Control the flow of contacts through multiple entry points

You likely give prospective contacts multiple ways to sign up for your
email and SMS marketing programs, such as multiple forms, text-to-join
keywords, and the marketing consent checkbox on your checkout page. Your
multiple welcome automations may contain entirely different content or
share content across automations. Depending on the setup of your welcome
automation, there are techniques you can implement to prevent contacts
from receiving redundant content or the same content multiple times.

If you choose to use multiple triggers (up to three) for your welcome
automation, you can prevent contacts from being sent through the
automation multiple times with the Limit Per Contact setting in your
automation trigger:

* Select `+Do not trigger when already in Automation+` if you’d like to
allow contacts to re-enter the welcome automation at some point. If a
contact unsubscribes from your content and re-subscribes later,
triggering the welcome automation again, they will be sent through the
automation again as long as they are not already in it.
* Select `+One time only+` if you do not want contacts to ever re-enter
the welcome automation. If a contact unsubscribes from your content and
re-subscribes later, they will not trigger the welcome automation again.

If you choose to create multiple separate welcome automations, you can
prevent contacts from completing more than one of your welcome
automations by:

. Selecting `+One time only+` as the Limit Per Contact setting in your
automation trigger, and
. Using an Update Automation > End Other action as the first node(s) in
all welcome automations to end any other welcome automations

[[actions-content]]
=== 3. Add welcome automation actions and content

Start your automation with a Send Message action and select email or
SMS, depending on which welcome automation you’re building:

. Click the *+ button* under the automation’s trigger(s)
. In the lefthand sidebar, click *Send Message*
. Click *Email* or *Send SMS*
(https://help.sendlane.com/article/449-automation-actions#notification[Send
Email Notification is intended for internal notifications], not sending
marketing messages)
. Complete your email or SMS node (see our guide to automation message
nodes
https://help.sendlane.com/article/449-automation-actions#send-message[here],
and check out our
https://help.sendlane.com/article/82-tags#tag-automation[guide to tags]
so you can capture contacts’ interests based on their clicks)
. Add a
https://help.sendlane.com/article/353-how-to-use-goals-and-conditional-splits-in-an-automation#timing[wait
node] between subsequent messages

You can end your welcome automation in multiple ways based on the goal
of your welcome automation:

* *Contacts make a purchase* - If your welcome automation series
includes coupons or other strong CTAs designed to encourage a purchase,
consider ending your welcome automation with a
https://help.sendlane.com/article/353-how-to-use-goals-and-conditional-splits-in-an-automation#goal[goal]
that checks to see whether or not contacts have purchased and pulls them
to a specified node, out of the automation entirely, or starts a new
automation once they have completed a purchase. You might also consider
using
https://help.sendlane.com/article/353-how-to-use-goals-and-conditional-splits-in-an-automation#conditional-splits[conditional
splits] to focus branches of your automation on specific products or
interests, or an
https://help.sendlane.com/article/353-how-to-use-goals-and-conditional-splits-in-an-automation#audience-split[audience
split] to A/B test different versions of similar content. Check out our
guide to https://help.sendlane.com/article/82-tags#tag-content[tags] to
learn how to apply tags to contacts based on the links they click.
* *Contacts learn about your brand* - If your welcome automation is more
focused on informing customers about your brand than convincing them to
buy from you, you may want to use
https://help.sendlane.com/article/449-automation-actions#update-contact[update
contact property actions] to unsubscribe contacts from your welcome list
and subscribe them to your newsletter list so they stay in the loop.

Whatever the goal of your automation is, you can keep contacts engaged
by using an
https://help.sendlane.com/article/449-automation-actions#update-automation[update
automation action] to start another automation.

[[test]]
=== 4. Test and activate your automation

To test your automation:

. Activate your
https://help.sendlane.com/article/668-how-to-activate-an-automation#node[email
nodes]
. Activate your
https://help.sendlane.com/article/668-how-to-activate-an-automation#automation[automation]
. Meet your welcome automation's trigger criteria; If you used one of
the more common welcome automation triggers mentioned above you can
follow its testing protocol: +
* Subscribes to a List - Add your email address to the list the same way
contacts will to ensure your setup will work for them
* Submits a Form - Submit the form specified in the trigger's settings
* SMS Consent Received - Use your phone number to complete SMS sign up
the same way your contacts will

If you successfully completed your automation, you're all set! If you
didn't receive messages you expected to receive, or otherwise didn't
experience your automation the way you want your contacts to,
