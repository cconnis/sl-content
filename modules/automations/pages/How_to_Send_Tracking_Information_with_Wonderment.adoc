===== ⚠️ The templates below will not work without a completed Wonderment integration

Follow the instructions in
https://help.sendlane.com/article/602-how-to-integrate-wonderment-and-sendlane[How
to Integrate Wonderment and Sendlane] before creating the email
templates below.

Ensure your custom events are named exactly as shown, with no additional
spaces or characters. If the event names do not match perfectly, the
templates below cannot pull order data into emails.

[[triggers]]
=== Wonderment Automation Triggers

The events you created in the custom event for your Wonderment
integration are used as Automation triggers. The table below describes
each available Wonderment Automation trigger, and when to use them:

[cols=",",]
|===

|`+Wonderment - Shipment Created+` |When a label has been created with a
shipping carrier

|`+Wonderment - Label Cancelled+` |When a label has been cancelled with
the shipping carrier

|`+Wonderment - Carrier Picked Up+` |When an order is first marked In
Transit by the carrier.

|`+Wonderment - In Transit+` |For each in-transit scan the package has.

|`+Wonderment - Out for Delivery+` |When the carrier confirms the
package has been handed off for delivery

|`+Wonderment - Ready for Pickup+` |When an order has been marked ready
for customer pickup by the shipping carrier, such as at a local office

[[wm-templates]]
=== Wonderment Template Examples

The templates below can be used as a starting point for building
Automation emails using Wonderment shipping data. To use the templates
below:

. Click Add Trigger
. Click the Sendlane tab to access the triggers you created
https://help.sendlane.com/article/602-how-to-integrate-wonderment-and-sendlane#events[as
custom integration events]
. Select a trigger
. Find the template below that corresponds to your trigger
. Copy and paste the text of a template below into a blank Automation
email
. Edit the copy and style your email

[[data-trigger]]
===== ⚠️ You must include the set data trigger

The first line of each email template includes the tag 
`+{% set data = trigger.getCustomEventData() %}+` , which allows
Wonderment data to be pulled into your email. Without this snippet, none
of your data will load, and contacts will receive mostly or entirely
blank emails.

[[hyperlink-error]]
===== ⚠️ You may need to strip text formatting when inserting the templates below into an automation email

When you paste one of the templates below into the email builder, it may
try to create hyperlinks for some data. This will cause an error that
says `+"Unexpected token "operator" of value "<"+`. If you see any blue
text after pasting, highlight all text and click the remove formatting
icon. This should clear the error, and you should be able to save your
email.

You can avoid this issue by pressing CMD + Shift + V on macOS or CTRL +
Shift + V on Windows to paste without formatting.

An update on your order

Hey {{ data.ShippingAddress.FirstName }}, we noticed your shipment hasn't been updated by the carrier in a few days.
