When you edit the flow of an active Automation, only edits to
existingÂ email content will be received by contacts in real-time. Any
other edits will not be seen by Contacts who are already moving through
the flow.

To manually re-trigger an Automation, you will create a Segment of
existing Contacts, send those Contacts a campaign, and add an Email
Campaign Opened trigger to your existing Automation.

=== Troubleshooting

====== My Campaign isn't showing up in the Email Campaign Opened trigger options!

Check that your Campaign has been scheduled. If your Campaign has been
saved as a draft, it will not appear in the trigger options.
