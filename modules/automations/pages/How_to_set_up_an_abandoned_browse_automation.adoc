===== ‚ö†Ô∏è Do not select additional or alternative triggers

The only trigger that is appropriate to use for an abandoned browse flow
is the Abandoned Product Viewed trigger. Do not select an alternative
trigger or add additional triggers to your abandoned browse automation.
Additional triggers can cause issues with your abandoned browse
automation.

[[trigger]]
=== 2. Configure abandoned browse trigger settings

When you select the Abandoned Product Viewed trigger, you‚Äôll see its
settings in the left-hand sidebar. These settings are the criteria
contacts need to meet to be sent through the automation.

* *Store* - Select the store you‚Äôre creating an abandoned browse
automation for
* *Limit Per Contact* - Not in the last, Once per day, or Do not trigger
when already in automation are recommended for abandoned browse
automations.
* *Consider abandoned after* - Select a time period of at least one
hour. The 5 minute and 30 minute settings are intended for internal
testing and may inundate contacts with messages if used in a live
automation.

You can specify individual products that should trigger the automation
by searching for and selecting products in the For Products section of
the trigger settings. If you do not select any specific products, all
products will trigger the automation.

Shopify and BigCommerce, and custom store users can apply a product tag
of `+sl-exclude+` to products that should not trigger the automation.
This process removes the product from Sendlane entirely. Read more about
excluding products
https://help.sendlane.com/article/601-how-to-exclude-products-from-product-blocks[here].

[[filter]]
=== 3. Filter out contacts who purchased during the wait time

The first node of your abandoned browse automation should be a
Conditional Split that checks to see whether contacts who met the
trigger settings‚Äô criteria have made a purchase during the wait time
selected for the ‚Äúconsider abandoned after‚Äù setting. On some platforms,
this check happens in the trigger settings and acts as a filter. The
functionality is the same with a conditional split.

To add a conditional split to your automation:

. Click the *+ icon* below the update automation node
. Click *Conditional Split*
. Set the conditional split's settings (see guidance below the
screenshot)

image:https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/vQQnanPxIx9ts9ZALSpQw2b8eVYIji7Bl0JQ0i8Vv_Knyz1VzdnGdxPxC_tcdA524Mh_wCSLagIKAxxaURtYFTPe1egJnNaDZ3qtmx2O-oyQnRgKFTqI4j5entTkGQ9GrMJbr1VjbvVqd0vglydhkL8[https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/vQQnanPxIx9ts9ZALSpQw2b8eVYIji7Bl0JQ0i8Vv_Knyz1VzdnGdxPxC_tcdA524Mh_wCSLagIKAxxaURtYFTPe1egJnNaDZ3qtmx2O-oyQnRgKFTqI4j5entTkGQ9GrMJbr1VjbvVqd0vglydhkL8,width=1680,height=1050]

When you select the conditional split, its settings will appear in the
left-hand sidebar:

image:https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/uQUG4GSG0spOgx1q-kZcgrYOlKBgvs5MwBP-ba_E4qK8_4HColdtjGkZdxliamDq52ox8wKED1rwB5baFZOtiPztKhgDQVZTxCEKmG3Hqik3g2Ux44I9ALbP-iUazrz2PCABMntIHBOsoK3nTzRJIN0[https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/uQUG4GSG0spOgx1q-kZcgrYOlKBgvs5MwBP-ba_E4qK8_4HColdtjGkZdxliamDq52ox8wKED1rwB5baFZOtiPztKhgDQVZTxCEKmG3Hqik3g2Ux44I9ALbP-iUazrz2PCABMntIHBOsoK3nTzRJIN0,width=377,height=249]

These settings will check for orders placed by the contact during the
day before they met the automation trigger‚Äôs criteria:

* *Condition* - Select your eCommerce solution (or custom integration)
* *Store* - Select the store you‚Äôre creating an abandoned browse
automation for
* *Resource* - Order
* *Order Status* - Any
* *Filter* - Order Date
* *Operator* - In the last
* Relative date range - 1 day

Add the rest of your automation‚Äôs nodes to the NO side so that you
target contacts who have NOT placed an order in the last day.

[[content]]
=== 4. Add Abandoned browse automation content

Now that the logic for your abandoned browse automation is in place, you
can add nodes for emails and SMS messages. For more information on
optimizing your email and SMS nodes, check out
https://help.sendlane.com/article/449-automation-actions#send-message[our
guide to automation nodes].

You can use the abandoned cart product block in email nodes to pull
information about the product that was browsed.

We highly recommend placing a wait node between messages to prevent
contacts from receiving too many messages too quickly.

[[goal]]
=== 5. Add a goal node to pull purchasers out of the automation

Depending on the number of message nodes and the length of wait nodes in
between, contacts may complete their purchase before being sent through
the entire automation. To prevent contacts from continuing to receive
abandoned browse content with a goal:

. Click the + button under the last node of your automation
. Click Goal
. Add a name for your goal, like "Completed purchase"
. In the Select condition dropdown, select your eCommerce integration
. Select your store
. Select Order
. Select Unfulfilled
. Select Order Date
. Select in the last
. Enter the number of days that it takes to complete your automation
. Click Done

[[test]]
=== 6. Test and activate your automation

You can test your abandoned browse automation with an email address that
is opted in to your account and
https://help.sendlane.com/article/72-beacon#what-is-beacon[has been

=== Troubleshooting

====== The abandoned cart block isn't available!

The abandoned cart block may not appear in your elements sidebar for two
common reasons:

. Your eCommerce integration is not set up correctly. Review your
eCommerce store's integration with Sendlane for possible connection
issues.
. You already added an abandoned cart block to your email. Only one
abandoned cart block is allowed per email.

====== A Contact abandoned a product view and didn‚Äôt move through the Automation!

The most common reason Contacts who view a product and do not move
through your browse abandonment Automation is that they are
https://help.sendlane.com/article/72-beacon#notes[browsing anonymously].
Tracking requires non-anonymous browsing in order to trigger the
Automation.
