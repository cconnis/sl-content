attributes!Â Read on to learn how to show or hide email blocks
conditionally.

==== Prerequisites

Conditionally showing or hiding content based on

requires enough contacts to have specified data in their profiles for
that custom field.

=== Show email blocks based on custom field data

You can conditionally show email blocks with just two snippets of
templating syntax:

. *Opening if statement* - Tells the email builder to check if the
condition in the if statement is true (the contact's profile contains
the specified data for the specified custom field). +
 +
If the if statement is true, the blocks between the if statement and the
endif tag will be displayed. If the if statement is false (the contact's
profile does not contain the specified data for the specified custom
field), the content between the if statement and the endif tag will not
be displayed.
. *endif tag* - Tells the email builder the if statement has ended

The example in the screenshot below shows a simple if statement in
action. Contacts whose profiles have the favorite color field populated
with red will see all blocks between the text blocks containing
templating syntax.

Each separate email builder block is surrounded by a gray box and
identified with a number in the screenshot below:

. A text block containing the opening if statement
`+{% if contact.custom('Favorite Color') == "red" %}+`
. A text block containing copy intended for recipients whose
`+Favorite Color+` custom field is set to `+red+`
. An image block containing an image intended for recipients whose
Favorite Primary Color custom field is set to red
. A text block containing the endif tag `+{%-endif-%}+`
. A text block containing copy intended for all recipients
. An image block containing an image intended for all recipients

Contacts whose `+Favorite Color+` custom field is set to `+red+` will
see the following in their inbox:

Contacts whose `+Favorite Color+` custom field is NOT set to `+red+`
(i.e., it is null or set to another color) will see the following in
