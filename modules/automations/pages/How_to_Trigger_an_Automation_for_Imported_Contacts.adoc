Importing contacts is a great way to migrate your audience into
Sendlane, but since imports don't trigger automations, here's how to do
just that!

'''''

=== Before Getting Started

If you have not yet imported your contacts, please review our import
guide
https://help.sendlane.com/article/190-how-to-import-contacts-into-your-account[here].

=== Triggering an Automation for Imported Contacts

. Create a https://help.sendlane.com/article/153-campaigns[campaign] to
send to your newly imported contacts - this could be a friendly
greeting, a newsletter, or any other content you'd like to share
+
====== Please Note

Do not send the message immediately, instead  _schedule_ the campaign to
send at a later time so you can complete the rest of the process and
create your automation.
. Once you've scheduled your campaign, head over to
_*Automations* → *New Automation*_ and select the *_Start from scratch_*
option
. Next, click to add a trigger, choose _Email Campaign Opened_ and
select the campaign you just created

. From here, you will be able to build out the rest of your automation
as desired, adding any
https://help.sendlane.com/article/73-automations#communications[actions&#44;
communications or goals] you'd like to use
. Once you've completed your automation be sure to set the funnel
from Inactive to *_Active_*

. From here, you can either allow your campaign to send out at the
originally scheduled time, or update the schedule to _Send Immediately_

Once the campaign has sent, any imported contacts that open your message
will trigger the automation and begin flowing through your funnel
automatically!

=== Troubleshooting

* If you cannot select the campaign you created, is the campaign in
Draft? It will need to be scheduled in order to select that campaign as
a trigger.
* Check to make sure the automation is Active once it is complete.
* Select the correct list to send the initial campaign to.

=== TL;DR

_Campaigns_ → _New Campaign_ → create your email → schedule campaign
(*do not send immediately*) → _Automations_ → _New Automation_ → _Start
from scratch_ → Add trigger _Email Campaign Opened_ → choose campaign
for imported contacts → finish building automation → _Activate_ → allow
campaign to send as scheduled, or update to _Send Immediately_
