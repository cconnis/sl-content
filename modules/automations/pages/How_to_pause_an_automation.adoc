==== Overview

You can pause an automation so that contacts moving through will still
reach the end, but no new contacts will start the automation. Read on to
learn how!

=== Pause an automation

When you deactivate an automation, no new contacts will start the
automation, but contacts who have already started the automation will
not be able to complete it.

You can pause an automation by replacing the triggers being used with a
trigger contacts cannot activate. Options include, but are not limited
to:

* A subscribe to list trigger where the selected list is not connected
to any sign up source
* A tag added trigger where the selected tag is not connected to any
automation or other process that adds the selected tag to a contact's
profile
* A submits a form trigger where the selected form is not installed
anywhere contacts can access
