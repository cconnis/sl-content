[[what-is-trigger]]
=== What is an Automation Trigger?

An Automation Trigger is the first node in an Automation. The Automation
Trigger tells the Automation when to start and which Contacts should be
sent through the Automation.

Sendlane provides a variety of standard and integration-specific
https://help.sendlane.com/article/188-contacts[Contact] activity types
to use as Automation Triggers, making it simple to send highly targeted
content to Contacts who are most likely to engage!

[[setup]]
=== Automation Trigger Setup

ClickÂ  *+* *Add Trigger*Â to access the Automation Triggers slideout
menu. Select the *trigger*Â and *conditions* that will start your
Automation. Click *Done* to save your selections!

You can add up to two additional triggers for a total of three triggers
per Automation.

[[multiple-trigger]]
===== ðŸš¨ Important Note

Using multiple triggers or multiple options in a single trigger creates
OR logic where Contacts must meet just one condition to be sent through
the Automation.

**A note about iOS 15 and Apple's Mail Privacy Protection's impactÂ on
email open data*

If any of your Automations use the _Email Campaign Opened_ trigger,
consider adding additional triggers to catch any Contacts using Apple
Mail with iOS 15 who may have Mail Privacy Protection turned on.
