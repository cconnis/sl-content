When integration modules are updated or you seem to be missing data, you
may need to re-sync an integration. Follow the instructions below to
safely re-sync your integrations in 3 easy steps!

1::
  If you have any Automations that use your integration's triggers
  you'll want to deactivate each Automation before re-syncing your
  integration.
  +
  If Automations using integration triggers are active while an
  integration is re-synced, the Automation will trigger, which could
  cause emails or SMS messages to send when you don't want them to!
  +
  To deactivate an Automation, click on
  https://app.sendlane.com/automations[the Automations icon in your
  sidebar] then click the *Deactivate* icon > *Deactivate*
