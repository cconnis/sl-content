Sendlane's deep data integrations with Shopify and OneClickUpsell allow
you to send targeted emails directly to contacts who abandon their
shopping cart!

With this automation, you can send emails to your prospective customers
about the product they were interested in along with a link to quickly
and seamlessly complete their purchase.

=== Creating an Abandoned Cart Automation

. Begin by clicking *_Automations_* on the left of your dashboard and
clicking *_New Automation_* on the top right
. Choose the *_eCommerce_* tab within the template options and
select _*Recover abandoned
carts*image:https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5d58e11a2c7d3a7920be2ce0/file-iogtwC0rVB.png[https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5d58e11a2c7d3a7920be2ce0/file-iogtwC0rVB]_
+
====== Please Note

Once you choose this option it will create an automation using Shopify
abandoned checkout as the trigger. The OneClickUpsell app uses the
Shopify abandoned trigger even if a OneClickUpsell upsell or downsell is
the only product abandoned.
. Once the pre-designed automation loads, click to configure
the __Customer Abandoned Checkout __trigger details:    
* _*Select a Shop*:_ Choose your Shopify store from the drop down menu
* _*Limit Per Subscriber*:_ How often you'd like for this automation to
be triggered for a potential customer
* _*Consider Abandoned After*:_ How long after the customer has
abandoned the shopping cart that you'd like the automation to start
(i.e., 1 hour, 3 hours) +

. Next, click on the *_Email_* action to edit/create the content that
you'd like to send to your customer. Follow the prompts to complete all
of the basic details, then continue along to the email design
. Inside the _Email Builder_, you'll see that the message has already
been pre-filled with _Abandoned Cart_ content. Only one abandoned cart
block is allowed per
email.image:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5e9dfced04286364bc98acb1/file-XhWijEPBAf.png[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5e9dfced04286364bc98acb1/file-XhWijEPBAf]
+
====== Please Note

The _Product Name_ and _Price_ sections will automatically populate
information from the product your customer added to their shopping cart
when the message is sent.
. Once you have completed the content for this email, click *_Save and
Continue_*
. Continue building your automation by adding any other
https://help.sendlane.com/article/73-automations#communications[actions
and communications] you'd like to use. Depending on what your goals and
objectives are, we recommend sending three emails over the next few days
to encourage contacts to come back and complete a purchase.
. Last but not least, don't forget set the automation to *_Active_* once
you're done building out your funnel +

And that's it! Anytime someone abandons their checkout with an OCU offer
in the cart, they'll receive a follow up series showing the products
they abandoned and an accessible button to bring them right back to
their cart to finish their purchase!

=== Troubleshooting

====== The abandoned cart block isn't available!

The abandoned cart block may not appear in your elements sidebar for two
common reasons:

. Your eCommerce integration is not set up correctly. Review your
eCommerce store's integration with Sendlane for possible connection
issues.
. You already added an abandoned cart block to your email. Only one
abandoned cart block is allowed per email.
