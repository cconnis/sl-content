=== Testing Webhooks with Sendlane

{empty}1. Use a Webhook tester like http://requestcatcher.com/[Request
Catcher] to create a test URL. Create a test subdomain to complete your
unique URL.

Now, we're going to take that same URL and use it to test integration
with Sendlane!

Lastly, don't forget to set your Automation as active!

. {empty}7. To test, add a contact to your list. You will be able to see
the result of your test in the Tester (Request Catcher) once the test
contact enters the Automation. It will show:
+
{empty}1. the contact's email address
+
{empty}2. the list ID (which list they were added to in Sendlane)
+
image:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5f779a8ec9e77c001621412f/file-edVrAEYohw.png[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5f779a8ec9e77c001621412f/file-edVrAEYohw]
+
Attain your unique webhook URL from the service you plan to Integrate
with Sendlane and paste it into the URL input, then Save and publish
your changes! Every contact that fits the parameters of the Automation's
trigger will have it's information logged in your Integration. You can
use the same steps to test your webhook
