While an entire deleted node cannot be recovered entirely, email content
remains in your automation even if the node is deleted.

You can select the deleted email node's email when you add another email
node to your automation:

. Click the *+ button* to add a new node
. Click *Send Message*
. Click *Email*
. Select your deleted email from the *Duplicate existing email for this
automation dropdown**

*Your deleted email will have the same name it had before it was deleted

Watch the video below to see how a deleted email node's content can be
recovered:
