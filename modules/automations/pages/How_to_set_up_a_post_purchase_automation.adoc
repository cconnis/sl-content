[[trigger]]
=== Background on triggers

You should use the Order Placed trigger for your post purchase
automation unless your storeâ€™s unique setup requires a different
trigger.

Other triggers commonly attempted for post purchase automations, such as
product purchased and checkout complete, do not provide as much utility
as the order placed trigger.

The product purchase trigger is unsuitable for most post purchase flows
because it fires on the product level instead of the order level; an
order with more than one product will trigger the automation once for
each product, with no way to reference all products in the order in an
email. The order placed trigger fires when an order is placed and
retains information about all products in the order.

The checkout complete trigger fires on the order level, but as soon as a
checkout is complete, information about the products that were in the
cart during checkout is moved out of the checkout table of Sendlaneâ€™s
database and into the order table of the database. This means that the
checkout completed trigger doesnâ€™t retain information about the contents
of the checkout.

* *Store* - Select the store youâ€™re creating an order placed automation
for
* *Limit Per Contact* - No Limit is recommended for post purchase
automations.
* *Order Status* - We suggest selecting unfulfilled
* *Frequency* - If you want contacts to be sent through the automation
every time they purchase, select [.underline]#Any#. If you want contacts
to be sent through the automation only on their first, second, or third
purchase, select the corresponding option.

[[prevent]]
=== 3. Prevent contacts from continuing through pre-purchase automations

The first node of your post purchase automation should be an update
automation node that ends your abandoned browse and abandoned cart
automations. Since placing an order is the last step in the pre-purchase
journey, you donâ€™t want contacts to keep receiving pre-purchase content
about orders theyâ€™ve already completed.

To add an update automation node:

. Click the *+ icon* below the Abandoned Checkout trigger
. Click *Update Automation*
. Click *End Other*
. From the Automation dropdown, select your
https://help.sendlane.com/article/663-how-to-set-up-an-abandoned-browse-automation[browse
abandon automation]
. Select a time period wait before allowing contacts to re-enter the
browse abandon automation once they've completed the abandoned browse
automation
. Click *Done*
. Repeat steps 1-6 and select your
https://help.sendlane.com/article/664-how-to-set-up-an-abandoned-cart-automation[abandoned
cart automation] for step 4
. Repeat steps 1-6 and select your
https://help.sendlane.com/article/662-how-to-set-up-an-abandoned-checkout-automation[abandoned
checkout automation] for step 4

[[content]]
=== 4. Post purchase automation content

For more information on optimizing your email and SMS nodes, check out
our guide to
https://help.sendlane.com/article/449-automation-actions#send-message[automation
nodes].

We highly recommend placing a wait node between messages to prevent
contacts from receiving too many messages too quickly.

[[split]]
===== ðŸ’¡ Optional: Add a conditional split to create nodes for specific products

Conditional Splits allow you to target specific products for specialized
content! If you'd like to create specific content for specific products
or product groups, create a Conditional Split node under your final End
Automation action and set the conditions for:

. Condition: Your eCommerce integration
. Resource: Order
. Filter: Product or Product Collection, depending on what you want to
target
. Operator: Select In to specify products or product groups present in
the order
. Select Items or Groups
. Click Done
. Create nodes under each path:

[cols="",]
|===
|Yes Path

|Customers who had the selected products or product groups in their
order
|===

[[test]]
=== 5. Test and activate your automation

You can test your abandoned browse automation by placing a test order in
your store with an email address that is opted in to your account. To
test your abandoned browse automation:

. Activate your
https://help.sendlane.com/article/668-how-to-activate-an-automation#node[email
nodes]
. Activate your
https://help.sendlane.com/article/668-how-to-activate-an-automation#automation[automation]
. Place a test order
. Check your inbox to ensure you received the first email in your post
purchase automation
. If you received the email, your automation was set up correctly and
should stay activated

If you successfully completed your automation, you're all set! If you
didn't receive messages you expected to receive, or otherwise didn't
experience your automation the way you want your contacts to,
