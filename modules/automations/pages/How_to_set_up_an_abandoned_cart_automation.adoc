===== üö¶ Before Getting Started

* Integrate your eCommerce store with Sendlane
* If you use BigCommerce,
https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Using-the-Abandoned-Cart-Saver?language=en_US[disable
BigCommerce Abandoned Cart Saver] if it is turned on
* https://help.sendlane.com/article/417-how-to-use-beacon-with-shopify#check-installation[Confirm
that Beacon general tracking is installed]

[[beacon-warning]]
===== ‚ö†Ô∏è Your abandoned cart automation WILL NOT WORK unless Beacon general tracking is installed

Beacon identifies website visitors and tells Sendlane when your
automation‚Äôs conditions have been met. If Beacon general tracking is not
installed on your store‚Äôs website, your abandoned cart automation will
never trigger.

[[background-triggers]]
=== Background on triggers

Customers generally see much higher revenue from
https://help.sendlane.com/article/662-how-to-set-up-an-abandoned-checkout-automation[abandoned
checkout automations] than abandoned cart automations. We recommend
setting up an abandoned checkout automation in addition to an abandoned
cart automation.¬†

Let‚Äôs investigate why, starting with the following table describing each
trigger associated with ‚Äúabandoned cart‚Äù automations:

[cols="",]
|===
|*Trigger name*
|Added to cart
|Abandoned cart
|Abandoned checkout
|===

The Abandoned checkout trigger doesn‚Äôt fire until the contact starts the
checkout process on your website (and the amount of time you select for
‚Äúconsider abandoned after‚Äù has passed), which means it has the context
of your contact‚Äôs entire cart. This data is sent to Sendlane from
Shopify and does not require the contact to be cookied via Beacon.

Abandoned product email blocks in automations using the abandoned
checkout trigger will populate with information on all the products in a
contact‚Äôs cart when they begin checkout, meaning contacts will be
reminded of each item in their cart when they receive the email.

Unlike the abandoned checkout trigger, the added to cart and abandoned
cart triggers do not capture or store data for the other products your
contact may have added to their cart.

These two triggers use site tracking data from Beacon to tell Sendlane
that an identified contact clicked "add to cart." This means that when
you add an abandoned product block to an email, only the first product
the contact added to their cart will appear in the email they receive.

[[#create]]
=== 1. Create an abandoned cart automation

Start your abandoned cart automation setup by creating an automation and
selecting the Abandoned Cart trigger:

. Click the Automations icon
. Click New Automation
. Click Start From Scratch
. Enter a name for your abandoned cart automation
. Click Start
. Click Add Trigger
. In the lefthand sidebar, click the Shopify or BigCommerce tab
. Click Abandoned Cart

[[multiple-trigger-warning]]
===== ‚ö†Ô∏è Do not select additional or alternative triggers

The only trigger that is appropriate to use for an abandoned cart flow
is the Abandoned Cart trigger. Do not select an alternative trigger or
add additional triggers to your abandoned cart automation. Additional
triggers can cause issues with your abandoned cart automation.

[[#trigger-settings]]
=== 2. Abandoned cart trigger settings

When you select the Abandoned Cart trigger, you‚Äôll see its settings in
the left-hand sidebar. These settings are the criteria contacts need to
meet to be sent through the automation.

image:https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcxTJPGjfocQU0pRUPm8S4CJY82e3TSjjminLiCfWEK9cVOPgliQ1Zi4Dpqx8s-dJruCeW9uUeuGr60hViNvmQrHKgN_FkembcABimHY7jmq7Ju2JLyJJvSPFBhqj0B8jJSUnNXZXkpnnski1ERUc6AsnO0?key=bu6MZ-sD4x248cujgnDXqA[https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcxTJPGjfocQU0pRUPm8S4CJY82e3TSjjminLiCfWEK9cVOPgliQ1Zi4Dpqx8s-dJruCeW9uUeuGr60hViNvmQrHKgN_FkembcABimHY7jmq7Ju2JLyJJvSPFBhqj0B8jJSUnNXZXkpnnski1ERUc6AsnO0?key=bu6MZ-sD4x248cujgnDXqA,width=382,height=705]

* Store - Select the store you‚Äôre creating an abandoned cart automation
for
* Limit Per Contact - Not in the last, Once per day, or Do not trigger
when already in automation are recommended for abandoned cart
automations.
* Consider abandoned after - Select a time period of at least one hour.
The 5 minute and 30 minute settings are intended for internal testing
and may inundate contacts with messages if used in a live automation.

You can specify individual products that should trigger the automation
by searching for and selecting products in the For Products section of
the trigger settings. If you do not select any specific products, all
products will trigger the automation.

Shopify, BigCommerce, and custom store users can apply a product tag of
sl-exclude to any product that should not trigger the automation. This
process removes the product from Sendlane entirely. Read more about
excluding products
https://help.sendlane.com/article/601-how-to-exclude-products-from-product-blocks[here].

[[end]]
=== 3. Prevent contacts from being sent through multiple pre-purchase automations

The first node of your abandoned cart automation should be an update
automation node that ends your abandoned browse automation when contacts
trigger the abandoned cart automation. Since adding items to the cart is
further in the purchasing process than browsing, you don‚Äôt want contacts
to receive both browse and cart abandon content.

To add an update automation node:

. Click the + icon below the Abandoned Cart trigger
. Click Update Automation
. Click End Other
. From the Automation dropdown, select your browse abandon automation
. Select a time period wait before allowing contacts to re-enter the
browse abandon automation once they've completed the abandoned cart
automation
. Click Done

[[#filter]]
=== 4. Filter out contacts who purchased during the wait time

The second node of your abandoned cart automation should be a
Conditional Split that checks to see whether contacts who met the
trigger settings‚Äô criteria have made a purchase during the wait time
selected for the Consider abandoned after setting. On some platforms,
this check happens in the trigger settings and acts as a filter. The
functionality is the same with a conditional split.

To add a conditional split to your automation:

. Click the + icon below the update automation node
. Click Conditional Split
. Set the conditional split's settings (see guidance below the
screenshot)

image:https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXf95oezluURP2EoOMXwLgTqawT7aiLoASmIteUId_ebdAuXkofgYaXUafx2RplQY8MI8YjkdirwTkMJg_KnOOBUhamZkrXWmlkGA9r-YUDrLRefBM-CaVpmBbCCVedPpMwFXCMgoFqsikA2tA_EujGT-UDo?key=bu6MZ-sD4x248cujgnDXqA[https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXf95oezluURP2EoOMXwLgTqawT7aiLoASmIteUId_ebdAuXkofgYaXUafx2RplQY8MI8YjkdirwTkMJg_KnOOBUhamZkrXWmlkGA9r-YUDrLRefBM-CaVpmBbCCVedPpMwFXCMgoFqsikA2tA_EujGT-UDo?key=bu6MZ-sD4x248cujgnDXqA,width=1680,height=1050]

When you select the conditional split, its settings will appear in the
left-hand sidebar:

image:https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcXiolCeMPYPJwaswCtXbjLQCp8XukzUvr0vcfZhTffPg5yabKfpl-xuoF4bZUlGcFFJv5GTaZVNSp6cyfaUenqRahqOgGfV4_Akb05VjXCXw7oSo2XEHEG6arSmtyW_jIS6B7srcDvhG1s0CLjOt4_HsAY?key=bu6MZ-sD4x248cujgnDXqA[https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcXiolCeMPYPJwaswCtXbjLQCp8XukzUvr0vcfZhTffPg5yabKfpl-xuoF4bZUlGcFFJv5GTaZVNSp6cyfaUenqRahqOgGfV4_Akb05VjXCXw7oSo2XEHEG6arSmtyW_jIS6B7srcDvhG1s0CLjOt4_HsAY?key=bu6MZ-sD4x248cujgnDXqA,width=361,height=521]

These settings will check for orders placed by the contact during the
day before they met the automation trigger‚Äôs criteria:

* Condition - Select Shopify or BigCommerce
* Store - Select the store you‚Äôre creating an abandoned cart automation
for
* Resource - Order
* Order Status - Any
* Filter - Order Date
* Operator - In the last
* Relative date range - 1 day

Add the rest of your automation‚Äôs nodes to the NO side so that you
target contacts who have NOT placed an order in the last day.

[[#content]]
=== 5. Abandoned cart automation content

Now that the logic for your abandoned cart automation is in place, you
can add nodes for emails and SMS messages. For more information on
optimizing your email and SMS nodes, check out our guide to
https://help.sendlane.com/article/449-automation-actions#send-message[automation
nodes].

We highly recommend placing a wait node between messages to prevent
contacts from receiving too many messages too quickly.

===== ‚ö†Ô∏è Emails must include an abandoned cart block

The Abandoned Cart email block displays the first product added to the
cart and abandoned, with a link to the Contact's cart (Contacts will be
taken to your website if they click this link on a different device than
the device they created the abandoned checkout on). Only one abandoned
cart block is allowed per email.

[[#goal]]
=== 6. Add a goal node to pull purchasers out of the automation

Depending on the number of message nodes and the length of wait nodes in
between, contacts may complete their purchase before being sent through
the entire automation. To prevent contacts from continuing to receive
abandoned cart content with a goal:

. Click the + button under the last node of your automation
. Click Goal
. Add a name for your goal, like "Completed purchase"
. In the Select condition dropdown, select your eCommerce integration
. Select your store
. Select Order
. Select Unfulfilled
. Select Order Date
. Select in the last
. Enter the number of days that it takes to complete your automation
. Click Done

[[#test]]
=== 7. Test and activate your automation

You can test your abandoned cart automation with an email address that
is opted in to your account. To test your abandoned cart automation:

. In your trigger's settings, set the "consider abandoned after" setting
to 5 minutes
. Activate your
https://help.sendlane.com/article/668-how-to-activate-an-automation#node[email
nodes]
. Activate your
https://help.sendlane.com/article/668-how-to-activate-an-automation#automation[automation]
. Log out of your Shopify store in all tabs
. Visit your website
. Add a product to your cart
. Wait at least five minutes
. Check your inbox to ensure you received the first email in your
abandoned cart automation

If you successfully completed your automation, you're all set! If you
didn't receive messages you expected to receive, or otherwise didn't
experience your automation the way you want your contacts to,

=== Troubleshooting

====== Why are Contacts showing as unsubscribed immediately after completing a purchase?

If your Shopify checkout page
https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/promoting-marketing/create-marketing/customer-emails#collect-customer-emails-from-the-checkout[pre-selects
the marketing email opt-in checkbox], Contacts who uncheck the marketing
email opt-in box during checkout will be unsubscribed from the
https://help.sendlane.com/article/96-how-to-integrate-shopify-and-sendlane#connecting[List
attached to your Shopify integration] as soon as checkout is complete.

====== The abandoned cart block isn't available!

The abandoned cart block may not appear in your elements sidebar for two
common reasons:

. Your eCommerce integration is not set up correctly. Review your
eCommerce store's integration with Sendlane for possible connection
issues.
. You already added an abandoned cart block to your email. Only one
abandoned cart block is allowed per email.
