[[goal]]
=== What is a goal?

When you add a goal to your automation, your contact will jump to that
step once they meet the condition (or conditions) specified in the goal.

Goals check whether contacts have met the condition specified every six
hours, until the default of one week has passed or the amount of time
specified in the "Max time to check for conditions" setting. To prevent
contacts from being pulled out of the automation too soon, goals should
always have a "Max time to check for conditions" setting that matches
the length of the automation.

Once a goal is reached, contacts will skip any action not yet executed
and proceed immediately to the following action or action you assign
below the goal.

[[branches]]
===== ⚠️ Goals are only aware of the branch they are nested in

If you use a conditional split in your automation and add a goal under
one side of the automation, the goal can only pull contacts out of the
automation once they reach the side of the conditional split that
contains the goal. You may need to create multiple goals for a single
automation to cover all branches.
