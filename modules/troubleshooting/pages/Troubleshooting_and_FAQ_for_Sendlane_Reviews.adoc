[[before]]
=== View errors that occur before import

You may see errors after uploading your import file but before your
import is processed due to issues with your .CSV file.

you receive an error message that says
`+The file has missing or invalid fields.+` after attempting to import a
file of reviews:

. Try importing again and ensure you select the correct provider from
the Product Review Source dropdown. This field determines how the import
tool interprets your file. Selecting the wrong Product Review Source
directs the import tool to the wrong interpretation template, and your
file will not

[[after]]
=== View errors that occur after import

When a review file import has been successfully imported, you'll see it
listed in the History section of the Import & Export tab of the Reviews
page.

If any reviews could not be imported, you'll see
`+Failed to be imported:+` with the number of reviews not imported in
the Results column. Click the download button in the Actions column to
download a file of reviews that could not be imported.

image:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/65e90c5e2411c5087b68415d/file-LRQ6LPgQg0.png[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/65e90c5e2411c5087b68415d/file-LRQ6LPgQg0]Each
row represents a review that could not be imported. Open the file to
review each row's error descriptions in the furthest right column, and
note that one review can have more than one error description.

[[product-id-not-found]]
=== Fix a "The product doesn't exist in our database" error

`+The product doesn’t exist in our database.+` is usually caused
by incorrect number formatting in the product ID column of your file
or a deleted product in your store. First, check your file for incorrect
number formatting if you receive this error. If you receive the error
again, check for deleted products in your store.

==== Check for incorrect number formatting

When .CSV files are opened with Excel or Google Sheets, sometimes you'll
be prompted to apply
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/display-numbers-in-scientific-exponential-notation-f85a96c0-18a1-4249-81c3-e934cd2aae25[scientific
formatting] to cells with long strings of numbers. Scientific formatting
attempts to shorten a long number or add decimal places for easier data
analysis, and unfortunately, this process renders the product ID
unreadable by Sendlane's import tool. We've seen the product ID column
converted to scientific formatting even when selecting No on the prompt
asking to convert the column. Your product ID column may have scientific
formatting applied if you see product IDs like `+18427E+12+` or
`+7792310000000.00+`.

There are two possible solutions:

. Make the following changes to your file, then save it as a .CSV and
upload to Sendlane:
.. Change the column's formatting to Number by following
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/available-number-formats-in-excel-0afe8f52-97db-41f1-b972-4b46e9f1e8d2[Microsoft's
instructions for Excel], or
https://support.google.com/docs/answer/56470?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop[Google's
instructions for Google Sheets]. Make sure the new number format does
not include commas.
.. Your file may still alter your product IDs by adding a decimal point
and two zeroes. Remove the decimal points
(https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/round-a-number-to-the-decimal-places-i-want-49b936f9-6904-425d-aa98-02ffb7f9a17b#:~:text=By%20using%20a%20button,digits%20after%20the%20decimal%20point.[Excel],
https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/660701a16b58437311e412bd/2024-03-29_10-59-20.png[Google
Sheets]) before saving your file.
. Retrieve the original .CSV export you received from your previous
reviews provider, do not open or alter it in any way, and import this
original file into Sendlane. By not opening the .CSV, you ensure that
your spreadsheet software can't inadvertently apply scientific
formatting to your product ID column and didn't inadvertently save the
file as an Excel (.XLSX) type file.

If you import your original .CSV file and receive the 
`+The product doesn’t exist in our database.+` error, follow the
instructions below to check for deleted products in your store.

==== Check for deleted products or site reviews

When products are deleted, they are no longer accessible to Sendlane.
Sendlane Reviews also does not natively support site reviews, which are
reviews for your entire store rather that a specific product.

To keep site reviews and reviews for deleted products, you can use your
eCommerce store's archived product function to create an archived
product for Sendlane to associate the review with.

Shopify users can follow the steps and video shown below. If you use
another eCommerce solution, use the help center to find instructions on
archiving a product and finding the product's ID.

. Click *Products*
. Click *Add Product*
. Enter a title for the product (for deleted products we suggest
"Archived Product" and for site reviews we suggest "Site Review")
. Click *Save*
. Scroll to the very bottom of the page
. Click *Archive Product*
. Copy the product ID from the end of the product page's URL
. Replace the existing product ID for any rows in your file containing
a `+The product doesn’t exist in our database.+` error with the ID you
copied from your archived product
. Import your file again

[[pending]]
=== Fix import status stuck at Pending

If your import status is set to Pending for longer than one hour, you
may have invalid characters in your review file. The following instances
are known to cause errors when importing and must be removed from the
file before importing again:

* The last character in a review is a forward slash `+\+`. Press CMD
(macOS) or CTRL (Windows) + F and enter `+\+` to find all instances of
the character. Remove all instances of the character and upload your
file
again.image:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/65ea1de0a7c9e24f3b1c0640/file-8JWXMMvzz8.png[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/65ea1de0a7c9e24f3b1c0640/file-8JWXMMvzz8]
* The file size is ≥ 10 MB. If your file is significantly larger than 10
MB, try breaking it up into smaller files

[[reviews-submitted-not-appearing]]
=== Reviews have been submitted via the widget on my website, but I don't see them in the Moderation tab!

This issue is generally due to the wrong store being connected to
Sendlane Reviews. Sendlane Reviews only supports one store per Sendlane
account. Ensure that your Sendlane Reviews script and widgets are only
installed in one store.
