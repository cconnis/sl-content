=== What Are UTM Parameters?

UTM parameters are key-value pairs separated by an ampersand that are
appended to a URL to determine the source of website traffic. When you
use UTM tracking, your analytics platform collects data about which link
a Contact clicked that can then be used to identify trends in content
that performs well.

Let's look at a URL in an email from the Sendlane marketing team
containing a link to
https://www.sendlane.com/blog/importance-of-reviews[a new blog on the
importance of reviews] for eCommerce to learn how UTM tracking can be
used in your marketing strategy:

....
https://www.sendlane.com/blog/importance-of-reviews?utm_campaign=sendlane%20blog&utm_source=email&utm_medium=fri-newsletter&utm_content=importance%20of%20reviews%20in%20ecom%20hyperlink
....

* `+https://www.sendlane.com/blog/importance-of-reviews+` is the base
URL, or the page that Contacts will land on if they click the
hyperlinked text in the email. 
* `+?+` the question mark signals the end of the base URL and the start
of UTM parameters
* `+utm_campaign=sendlane%20blog+` is the Campaign key-value pair, where
utm_campaign is the key and sendlane%20blog is the value 
* `+&+` the ampersand signals that there are additional UTM parameters
attached to the URL
* `+utm_source=email+` is the Source key-value pair, where source is the
key and email is the value 
* `+utm_medium=fri-newsletter+` is the Medium key-value pair, where
medium is the key and fri-newsletter is the value 
* `+utm_content=importance%20of%20reviews%20in%20ecom%20hyperlink+` is
the content key-value pair, where content is the key and
importance%20of%20reviews%20in%20ecom%20hyperlink is the value

From just one click, the Sendlane marketing department can determine
that a Contact opened a Friday newsletter email and clicked on a link to
the blog about reviews. The Sendlane team now knows this person is at
least somewhat interested in Reviews and could add a Tag to the
Contact's profile to make sure they get more content about Reviews.

=== Determine Global and Customized UTM Settings

The UTM medium and content parameters in the above example from the
Sendlane marketing blog are very specific to that individual email and
won't provide useful data if applied globally because their focus is too
small. Applying `+utm_medium=fri-newsletter+` parameter to all emails
will make it seem like all email traffic comes from the Friday
newsletter, and
`+utm_content=importance%20of%20reviews%20in%20ecom%20hyperlink+`
applied globally will make it seem like the only link anyone ever clicks
on is this specific link.

Generally, source and medium parameters are appropriate to set globally
because they are unlikely to change frequently. Campaign, term, and
content parameters tend to be customized for individual emails.

Looking again at the example URL above, global UTM Tracking and
customized UTM Tracking set up in Sendlane would look like this:

==== Global UTM Tracking

Since the Sendlane marketing team uses a variety of values for Campaign,
Term, and Content, those parameters are turned off on the UTM Tracking
page. Only Source and Medium are turned on globally.

==== Customized UTM Tracking

On the settings page of the email builder, the Sendlane marketing team
decides to override the global values of Medium and Campaign. All other
Campaign emails will still set the parameters and values on the UTM
Tracking page unless they are individually customized. The content
parameter is also specified in the individual email because not all
emails contain the same content, and Term is left unchecked because it
is not needed.
