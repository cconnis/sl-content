This article explains how to set branding fonts for your account and where you'll find them in Sendlane.
--

[#intro]
== Introduction

You can specify up to nine fonts to be displayed prominently anywhere font selectors appear in Sendlane, including the email builder, form builder, and reviews.

Branding fonts are not available for https://help.sendlane.com/article/404-how-to-customize-your-unsubscribe-and-email-preferences-pages[email subscription pages].

[#font-limitations]
== Brand font limitations

Fonts are stored as files on mobile and desktop devices.
All desktop computers and mobile devices ship with some pre-installed fonts.
This means there is a (relatively small) collection of fonts you can reasonably expect all of your contacts’ devices to have installed.

When contacts receive emails that use fonts installed on their device, the font loads quickly and easily because the device does not have to take the extra step to fetch the font from the email.

Unfortunately, sometimes imported fonts don’t display as expected on certain devices and email apps.
When that happens, contacts will see the fallback font you select when you import a font.

You may have heard certain fonts described as “email-safe fonts,” but this is a marketing term used to describe commonly installed fonts.
It does not guarantee that the fonts described as “email-safe” will render successfully in all email client and device configurations.

Sendlane’s default font options are all commonly installed fonts that generally load without issue.
However, because of the many variations possible for email client and device configurations, it is always possible that a few emails will render a fallback option instead of your preferred font.

Select a web safe font to ensure your custom font is displayed correctly.
You can use https://www.cssfontstack.com/[CSS Font Stack] to see a collection of widely installed fonts that should render correctly on your contacts’ devices and https://www.caniemail.com/features/css-font-weight/[Can I Email] for community developed information about email client font support (Sendlane does not control either of these resources).

The following email apps support brand fonts:

* Apple Mail - macOS and iOS
* Samsung Mail - Android 8.0 and up
* Outlook for Mac

[#gmail]
[IMPORTANT]
.Many Gmail inbox apps and device combinations do not support brand fonts
====
Because Gmail has the largest market share for inbox providers, be aware
that brand fonts may not render for most of your audience. It is
important to pick a fallback font you are truly satisfied with because
many contacts will see your fallback.
====

[#fallback]
== Font fallbacks

Font fallbacks are alternative fonts known to be widely supported across
various inbox apps and devices. Fallback fonts will be used in your
email if your primary font is unavailable for a contact’s device or mail
app. Select a fallback option that most closely resembles your custom
font.

Font fallbacks are tried in the order they appear. In the example below,
the email will first try to use Arial if the primary font fails. If
Arial fails, then Helvetica will be tried. If both Arial and Helvetica
fail, then Futura will be tried.

IMPORTANT: Brand fonts are set for an entire account. It is not possible to set separate brand fonts for more than one store under the same account.

[#regular-font-weight]

[#set-font]
== How to use a branding font

You can change text in any email, form, or reviews widget to a branding
font.

When you select your branding font, you'll first select the family (the name of your font), then select a font weight.

The bold button in the text styling menu will select the font family's 700 weight font, if available.

If you've added variants that include italic options, use the italic button in the text styling menu to apply them:

== Troubleshooting

====== My custom fonts aren't being applied in the email builder OR my custom fonts are loading on some devices but not others.

If you are trying to select a custom font and your text isn't changing,
you likely have multiple separate uploads of the same custom font
family. All custom font variants should be uploaded via the original
font's entry on your branding page.

Brand fonts rendering on some devices but not others
link:#font-limitations[is normal], but can also be caused by having
multiple versions of the same font installed in separate instances.

If you see multiple versions of the same font, as shown below in the
lefthand column, delete all but one. Then, review the
link:#custom[instructions for importing a custom font file] and see step
6 for instructions on adding variants to custom fonts.
