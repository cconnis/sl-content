This article explains how to create and manage additional user accounts.

== Introduction

Creating additional users is a great way to allow access to your Sendlane account without needing to share your account's email address and password.
You can also specify what type of access your users should have to your account!

== Create a User Profile

User profile restrictions:

* Role based email addresses (like info@domain.com, sales@domain.com,
support@domain.com, etc.) cannot be used for user accounts.

* Email addresses cannot be used more than once. If you see the error `The email has already been taken`, the email address is associated with an existing Sendlane account. Use https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/recipients-in-exchange-online/plus-addressing-in-exchange-online[plus addressing] to create more than one account for the same email address.

To create a new user account:

. Click the *Account* icon
. Click *Access*
. Click *New User*
. Enter the new user's name
. Enter the new user's email address (note that users' email addresses
cannot be changed once the user profile has been created)
. Select a

level]
. Click *Confirm*

Your new user will receive an email with a link to log in to their new account and create a password.
Invitations to finish creating an account expire after 24 hours.
