== Troubleshooting

[#invalid]
====== I see "invalid action" or another error when testing my unsubscribe and preferences pages!

These errors are usually caused by being logged into Sendlane while testing.
Try logging out of Sendlane and testing your links again.

[#selections]
====== How can I set up preference options for contacts to select specific Lists to subscribe to?

Sendlane does not currently provide a way for contacts to update their preferences other than unsubscribing from all emails or SMS messages.

[#rearrange]
====== How can I rearrange the blocks on the Unsubscribe/Profile page?

It is not possible to rearrange the blocks for updating subscription options, communication preferences, and reporting email abuse.
