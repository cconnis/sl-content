[#intro]
== Introduction

Attribution window settings can be adjusted on the settings page to match attribution settings in previous providers or changing marketing strategies.

Check out https://help.sendlane.com/article/542-how-sendlane-attributes-revenue-to-email-and-sms[How Sendlane calculates attribution] for an overview of Sendlaneâ€™s attribution defaults and best practices before adjusting your own attribution settings.

[#considerations]
==== Considerations to make before changing attribution settings

* Adjusted attribution settings will be applied to reporting only for messages sent or Contact actions taken after the changes are made.
For example, if you adjust attribution settings and later a Contact engages with a campaign sent before changes were made and makes a purchase that meet new attribution qualifications, that conversion will be applied to the older Campaign.
Purchases made before the attribution settings were adjusted that qualify for the new attribution settings will not be retroactively applied to Campaign reporting.
* Automation attribution will not reset when attribution settings are updated.
Revenue attribution for Automation message nodes will continue to sum cumulatively when attribution settings are adjusted.
* Attribution settings are applied to Campaigns and Automations as soon as you click Save Changes.

Users who have moved to Sendlane from another platform should adjust attribution to match the settings used in the previous platform for continuity.

If you're not sure what your previous attribution settings were, check out the help docs below from popular providers on their default attribution settings and where to look for customized settings:
