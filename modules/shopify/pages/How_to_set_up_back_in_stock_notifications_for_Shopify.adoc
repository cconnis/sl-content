=== Troubleshooting

[[notify-button-mods]]
====== The Notify me when available button doesn't match my theme!

If the standard back in stock script cannot match your store's theme,
you can fix this by adding the `+product_page_button_class: "btn",+`
setting to the script with your theme's specific button class. The
adjusted standard script will look something like this (note the
addition ofÂ `+product_page_button_class: "btn",+`Â in settings):

....
<script src="https://sendlane.com/scripts/sendlane-backinstock-widget.lib.js"></script>
<script> 
    SendlaneBackInStock.configure({
    account: {
        token: "PUBLIC_TOKEN",
        platform: "shopify",
    },
    settings: {
        cta_button: {
            text: "Notify me when available",
            product_page_form_element_selector: ".product-form",
        product_page_button_class: "btn",
        },
        modal: {
            headline: "Get notified when this product is back in stock.",
            email_field_label: "Email",
            button_label: "Notify me when available",
            success_message: "We will notify you when it becomes available",
            disable_phone_field: true,
        }
    }
})
</script>
....

`+btn+` and `+button+` are common generic button classes. If using the
script above with the class set to `+btn+` doesn't work, try changing
`+btn+` to `+button+`.

If neither `+btn+` or `+button+` work, you'll need to use Chrome's
inspect tool to find the button class your theme is using. If you
haven't used the Chrome inspect tool before, check out
https://help.sendlane.com/article/522-how-to-install-reviews-shopify#product-page-collections[this
video] on using the inspect tool to find the correct place to install
the star rating widget for Sendlane Reviews. Use the technique shown in
the video to highlight and identify the class associated with buttons in
your store.

You should see `+<div>+` tags related to buttons with a button class
specified, like this:

image:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/66197d874db6eb7a51d9373f/file-RcpiUJXwHn.png[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/66197d874db6eb7a51d9373f/file-RcpiUJXwHn]In
this specific instance, you'd replace theÂ `+btn+`Â in the modified script
above with `+shopify-payment-button+`.

Replace the button class in the script with button classes found in your
theme until the back in stock notification button matches your theme.

====== The Notify me when available button is showing up in an odd place!

The basic back in stock script uses the
`+product_page_form_element_selector: ".product-form",+` setting to
determine where the back in stock button appears. Most Shopify themes
use the class `+.product-form+` for the area of the product page where
the variant and add to cart buttons are.

If your back in stock button appears somewhere odd on your product page,
your theme either uses a class other than `+.product-form+` for its
product page selection buttons, or does not have a class (this is where
the other method comes in, check stamped and klaviyo). You can fix this
by changing the `+product_page_form_element_selector: ".product-form",+`
setting from `+.product-form+` to your theme's class. Some common
alternate classes are `+.product-single__form+` and `+js-product-form+`.

The adjusted standard script will look something like this (note the
change of `+.product-form+` to `+.product-single__form+` in the
`+product_page_form_element_selector+`Â line):

....
<script src="https://sendlane.com/scripts/sendlane-backinstock-widget.lib.js"></script>
<script> 
    SendlaneBackInStock.configure({
    account: {
        token: "PUBLIC_TOKEN",
        platform: "shopify",
    },
    settings: {
        cta_button: {
            text: "Notify me when available",
            product_page_form_element_selector: ".product-single__form",
        product_page_button_class: "btn",
        },
        modal: {
            headline: "Get notified when this product is back in stock.",
            email_field_label: "Email",
            button_label: "Notify me when available",
            success_message: "We will notify you when it becomes available",
            disable_phone_field: true,
        }
    }
})
</script>
....

If neither `+.product-single__form+` or `+js-product-form+` work to
place your button beneath the add to cart button, you'll need to use
Chrome's inspect tool to determine the correct class for your theme.
Note that the correct class will be unique, meaning it will appear only
once in your product page's theme file.

You should seeÂ  `+<div>+`Â tags related to product information with a
class specified, like this:

image:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/66197d874db6eb7a51d9373f/file-RcpiUJXwHn.png[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/66197d874db6eb7a51d9373f/file-RcpiUJXwHn]In
this specific instance, you'd replace theÂ `+btn+`Â in the modified script
above withÂ `+shopify-payment-button+`.

Replace the button class in the script with button classes found in your
theme until the back in stock notification button matches your theme.
