=== Available data types in Shopify automations

Order and product data can be dynamically inserted into certain Shopify
automation emails, depending on the automation's trigger.

When specified events occur, such as a website visitor clicking an "add
to cart" button, a webhook sends a payload of related data to Sendlane.
That data can be dynamically inserted into automation emails.

The data you can render in an automation email depends on the event that
triggers the automation and that event's place in the buying cycle:

[cols=",,",]
|===
|*Action* |*Event sent to Sendlane contains* |*Automation triggered*

|Customer clicks on a product page AND does not complete an order within
the specified time |Product data |Abandoned product viewed

|Customer clicks "add to cart" |Product data |Added to cart

|Customer clicks "add to cart" AND does not complete an order within the
specified time |Product data |Abandoned cart

|Customer clicks "start checkout" AND does not complete an order within
the specified time |Checkout data |Abandoned checkout

|Customer completes an order |Order data |Order placed

=== Formatting and rendering templating syntax

[[b83734b4-2a12-41fa-9a0a-7d75b0ba2ffc]]
==== Prepare your email for templating syntax with an assignment tag

The assignment tag tells the email builder to look out for templating
syntax that needs to be rendered into plain language. Without the
assignment tag, your templating syntax will not render and will appear
to contacts as raw templating syntax.

Insert the appropriate assignment tag according to the table above in a
text element at the very top of your email. The assignment tag will not
be visible in email previews, test emails, or live emails.

All other elements in your email must be below the text element
containing the assignment tag.

The screenshots below show a draft email with an assignment tag
correctly set, templating syntax that renders basic information about an
order, and the results of previewing the draft:

===== ⚠️ Previews of templating syntax render using a randomly selected contact profile

The email builder’s preview function displays the syntax rendered as the
plain language using data from a randomly selected contact profile.

You may see some pieces of syntax “disappear” when you click Preview.
This means that the randomly selected contact did not have that data in
their profile.

For example, if you insert contacts’ billing address with templating
syntax in your email and the randomly selected contact profile does not
have a billing address, the billing address syntax will appear blank.

To force a new randomly selected contact profile, log out of Sendlane
and log in again.

[[loop]]
==== Create loops to display all products in an order

If you use product related templating syntax without a loop, only the
first product from the order or checkout will be rendered in the email.

To add a loop function:

[arabic]
. Copy the following loop tag `+{% for product in order.line_items %}+`

[arabic, start=2]
. Paste the loop tag directly above the beginning of your product
related syntax

[arabic, start=3]
. Copy the following end loop tag `+{% endfor %}+`

[arabic, start=4]
. Paste the end loop tag directly below the end of your product related
syntax

For example, the syntax below will display a list containing the name of
each product in the randomly selected order or checkout used by the
email builder preview:

*Order*

[source,code]
----
{% for product in order.line_items %}
{{product.title}}
{% endfor %}
----

*Checkout*

[source,code]
----
{% for product in checkout.line_items %}
{{product.title}}
{% endfor %}
----

[[e1b6602a-861b-4501-bf57-5546444ecb8d]]
==== Provide context for all templating syntax in your email

Templating syntax returns raw data without contextual labels

For example, the order number tag `+{{order.name}}+` returns a raw order
number without indication that it is an order number.

If you do not include text that provides context for your templating
syntax, your email will be difficult to understand.

The table below shows the results of templating syntax with and without
manually added contextual labels:

[cols=",",]
|===
|*Content* |*Renders as*
|`+{{order.name}}+` |#1032
|Order number: `+{{order.name}}+` |Order number: #1032
|===

=== Other Shopify data

The examples and references above represent the most commonly available
and valuable data that can be dynamically pulled into emails using
templating syntax. However, Shopify may provide more useful data that
you can take advantage of!

Advanced users can use the `+json_encode+` function to look at all data
available with a given automation trigger.

To see available data:

[arabic]
. Open an automation

[arabic, start=2]
. Select an order or checkout related trigger

[arabic, start=3]
. Add an email node

[arabic, start=4]
. Set the email node’s name and subject line to anything you like

[arabic, start=5]
. Click Edit Email

[arabic, start=6]
. Click Start From Scratch

[arabic, start=7]
. Add a text box to your email

[arabic, start=8]
. Copy the following snippet depending on whether your trigger is order
or checkout based:
[loweralpha]
.. Checkout: `+{{ trigger.checkout | json_encode }}+`
[loweralpha, start=2]
.. Order: `+{{ trigger.order | json_encode }}+`

[arabic, start=9]
. Paste the snippet into the text box

[arabic, start=10]
. Click Preview

In the email preview, you’ll see a large block of JSON that is difficult
to read. Copy the entire block, then paste it into a JSON parser, like
http://jsonformatter.org/[jsonformatter.org], to see your data in a
structured format:

image:https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdpf4BiHSrw8-a0yt9lCbjrlfNVvM_DfrygRBJerXOJGAZhzPVdX-kHIUzck40RXCmisOkKxaE-MNlRvGyCRgAfXqJHOb0MCJu-DDS8JGGsfszEafjd-7ROZfJUz4A9Djj6ckwiVgolI7gNViG00642mN9z?key=i2wcvCyEL3MR7kyQvhKKZg[AD_4nXdpf4BiHSrw8-a0yt9lCbjrlfNVvM_DfrygRBJerXOJGAZhzPVdX-kHIUzck40RXCmisOkKxaE-MNlRvGyCRgAfXqJHOb0MCJu-DDS8JGGsfszEafjd-7ROZfJUz4A9Djj6ckwiVgolI7gNViG00642mN9z?key=i2wcvCyEL3MR7kyQvhKKZg]

You can now select items to render in your automation emails from the
parsed JSON. For example, let's grab that order_status_url towards the
bottom of the parsed JSON above.

An order status URL would only be appropriate in an order placed
automation, so we'll use the `+{% set order = trigger.getOrder() %}+`
assignment tag in a text element at the very top of the email.

If we paste `+order_status_url+` into our email at this point, nothing
will happen even though we have the correct assignment tag set. We need
to format the syntax properly first.

Now, we need to show the assignment tag where to look for syntax that
needs to be rendered. Since we're using the order assignment tag,
we'll add the word order and a period before `+order_status_url+` to get
`+order.order_status_url+`, and finish with a space plus two curly
brackets surrounding the syntax: `+{{ order.order_status_url }}+`
