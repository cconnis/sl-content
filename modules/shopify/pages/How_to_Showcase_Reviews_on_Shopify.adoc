  to promote on your hand curated layout. To find high quality reviews:
  +
  . Click the *Reviews* icon

  +
  Copy your selected reviews' text and the name of the reviewer to a
  document for easy reference and have that document plus your saved
  images handy before moving on to create your layout.
  +
  If you want to match the color of the stars in your reviews widget on
  your displayed reviews, navigate to the
  https://app.sendlane.com/product-review/1/main-widget/styling[main
  widget styling page] and copy the hex code of the star color:

  Because we're using Shopify's existing theme blocks instead of a
  Sendlane-created carousel widget, you have multiple options for the
  layout of your carousel or other reviews display.
