Beacon general tracking is not installed.

===== ðŸ™‹ How Does the Beacon Pixel Work?

Sendlaneâ€™s Beacon tracking pixel collects information about your
Contacts' pageview and purchase activity.Â For the pixel to begin
tracking, the viewer must opt into your marketing emails, open an email
from you, and click a link in an email from you. The Beacon tracking
pixel cannot identify anonymous viewers.

Once tracking begins, please allow up to 24 hours for reporting to
populate accurately.

Follow the instructions below to set up a browse abandonment Automation
and start winning back revenue from products viewed!

=== Troubleshooting

====== The abandoned cart block isn't available!

The abandoned cart block may not appear in your elements sidebar for two
common reasons:

. Your eCommerce integration is not set up correctly. Review your
eCommerce store's integration with Sendlane for possible connection
issues.
. You already added an abandoned cart block to your email. Only one
abandoned cart block is allowed per email.
