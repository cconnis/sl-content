[[beacon-installation-required]]
===== ‚ö†Ô∏è Your abandoned checkout automation WILL NOT WORK unless Beacon is installed

Beacon identifies website visitors and tells Sendlane when your
automation‚Äôs conditions have been met. If Beacon is not installed on
your store‚Äôs website, your abandoned checkout automation will never
trigger.

=== Background on triggers

¬†You‚Äôre probably used to referring to this automation as an ‚Äúabandoned
cart‚Äù flow and using an automation trigger that fires when someone adds
a product to their cart and doesn‚Äôt check out for a specified period of
time.

At Sendlane, we recommend a slightly different setup that has
consistently led to better revenue performance for the majority of
Sendlane customers.

Let‚Äôs investigate why, starting with the following table describing each
trigger associated with ‚Äúabandoned cart‚Äù automations:

[cols="",]
|===
|*Trigger name*
|Added to cart
|Abandoned cart
|Abandoned checkout
|===

Unlike the abandoned checkout trigger, the added to cart and abandoned
cart triggers do not capture or store data for the other products your
contact may have added to their cart. This means that when you add an
abandoned product block to an email, only the first product that the
contact added to their cart will appear in the email they receive.

The Abandoned checkout trigger doesn‚Äôt fire until the contact starts the
checkout process on your website (and the amount of time you select for
‚Äúconsider abandoned after‚Äù has passed), which means it has the context
of your contact‚Äôs entire cart. Abandoned product email blocks in
automations using the abandoned checkout trigger will populate with
information on all the products in a contact‚Äôs cart when they begin
checkout, meaning contacts will be reminded of each item in their cart
when they receive the email.

The abandoned checkout trigger targets contacts who have actively
initialized the checkout process, rather than contacts who added an item
to their cart. When you use the abandoned checkout trigger, you‚Äôre
targeting contacts who are much more engaged and ready to buy!

=== 2. Trigger settings

When you select the Abandoned Checkout trigger, you‚Äôll see its settings
in the left-hand sidebar. These settings are the criteria contacts need
to meet to be sent through the automation.

image:https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/gl0Zol3wnx4_QIcqKiI1_NUl8wBoFMIDlIhCepR7EFMNQfp-L2j9BIgWTyQFbRxap9zy9KhmdpTDEukfXGkxE1hOFBJewRxubC4rsXga-WPFocJYmIOgPUX7LKRnwYmfknE-F_PbDxfsl8l7wYhbauM[https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/gl0Zol3wnx4_QIcqKiI1_NUl8wBoFMIDlIhCepR7EFMNQfp-L2j9BIgWTyQFbRxap9zy9KhmdpTDEukfXGkxE1hOFBJewRxubC4rsXga-WPFocJYmIOgPUX7LKRnwYmfknE-F_PbDxfsl8l7wYhbauM,width=341,height=502]

* *Store* - Select the store you‚Äôre creating an abandoned cart
automation for
* *Limit Per Contact* - Once per day or Do not trigger when already in
automation are recommended for abandoned checkout automations.
* *Consider abandoned after* - Select a time period of at least one
hour. The 5 minute and 30 minute settings are intended for internal
testing and may inundate contacts with messages if used in a live
automation.

=== 3. End your abandoned browse automation for contacts who trigger the abandoned checkout automation

The first node of your abandoned checkout automation should be an update
automation node that ends your abandoned browse automation when contacts
trigger the abandoned checkout automation. Since checkout is further in
the purchasing process than browsing, you don‚Äôt want contacts to receive
both browse and checkout abandon content.

To add an update automation node:

. Click the *+ icon* below the Abandoned Checkout trigger
. Click *Update Automation*
. Click *End Other*
. From the Automation dropdown, select your browse abandon automation
. Select a time period wait before allowing contacts to re-enter the
browse abandon automation once they've completed the abandoned checkout
automation
. Click *Done*

=== 4. Filter out contacts who purchased during the wait time

The second node of your abandoned checkout automation should be a
Conditional Split that checks to see whether contacts who met the
trigger settings‚Äô criteria have made a purchase during the wait time
selected for the Consider abandoned after setting. On some platforms,
this check happens in the trigger settings and acts as a filter. The
functionality is the same with a conditional split.

To add a conditional split to your automation:

. Click the *+ icon* below the update automation node
. Click *Conditional Split*
. Set the conditional split's settings (see guidance below the
screenshot)

image:https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/wJe_kajObshM0YooOBeV7tI5Gj_jMpDjHdQIHmoab9CMcC9wpt3tSirauLGfG7Rb8RSNCsfZPBLHNvuNWK1Wh8W4sJlZtXyGeh1r_uyS3fCltV-_v2QtXs70XnDG1-nXDy9rIC-pmJEKvhhUh1-9Vao[https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/wJe_kajObshM0YooOBeV7tI5Gj_jMpDjHdQIHmoab9CMcC9wpt3tSirauLGfG7Rb8RSNCsfZPBLHNvuNWK1Wh8W4sJlZtXyGeh1r_uyS3fCltV-_v2QtXs70XnDG1-nXDy9rIC-pmJEKvhhUh1-9Vao,width=1475,height=1195]

When you select the conditional split, its settings will appear in the
left-hand sidebar:

image:https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/TacsgtSYAEhetr64MTJClCC2Wynvdvwq8rQwPEWqvdF9xzHDDESJGuf75HIgb9fqvI49jz0n3QXvuxHsc-DhZzqI1Lz6MhDNogvSjijkF9sH_Ql6ikzHNCqi6GK1dji1GbfjMhUzh_7luuOL0v64rpc[https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/TacsgtSYAEhetr64MTJClCC2Wynvdvwq8rQwPEWqvdF9xzHDDESJGuf75HIgb9fqvI49jz0n3QXvuxHsc-DhZzqI1Lz6MhDNogvSjijkF9sH_Ql6ikzHNCqi6GK1dji1GbfjMhUzh_7luuOL0v64rpc,width=361,height=521]

These settings will check for orders placed by the contact during the
day before they met the automation trigger‚Äôs criteria:

* *Condition* - Select Shopify or BigCommerce
* *Store* - Select the store you‚Äôre creating an abandoned cart
automation for
* *Resource* - Order
* *Order Status* - Any
* *Filter* - Order Date
* *Operator* - In the last
* *Relative date range* - 1 day

Add the rest of your automation‚Äôs nodes to the NO side so that you
target contacts who have NOT placed an order in the last day.

[[split-checkout]]
===== üí° Optional: Add another conditional split to create nodes for specific products

Conditional Splits allow you to target specific products for specialized
content! If you'd like to create specific content for specific products
or product groups, create a Conditional Split node under the NO path of
your order placed conditional split¬†and set the conditions for:

. Condition: Shopify
. Resource: Checkout
. Filter: Product or Product Collection, depending on what you want to
target
. Operator: Select In to specify products or product groups present in
the abandoned checkout
. Select Items or Groups
. Click Done
. Create nodes under each path:

[cols=",",]
|===
|*Yes Path* |*No Path*

|Customers who had the selected products or product groups in their
abandoned checkout |Customers who DID NOT have the selected products or
product groups in their abandoned checkout
|===

=== 5. Content

Now that the logic for your abandoned checkout automation is in place,
you can add nodes for emails and SMS messages. For more information on
optimizing your email and SMS nodes, check out our guide to
https://help.sendlane.com/article/449-automation-actions#send-message[automation
nodes].

We highly recommend placing a wait node between messages to prevent
contacts from receiving too many messages too quickly.

[[blocks]]
===== ‚ö†Ô∏è Emails must include an abandoned cart block

The Abandoned Cart email block¬†displays the product abandoned in the
Contact's cart and a link to the Contact's cart (Contacts will be taken
to your website if they click this link on a different device than the
device they created the abandoned checkout on). Only one abandoned cart
block is allowed per email.

[[cart-link]]
===== üí° Optional: use the following snippet to add a direct link to Contacts' carts in hyperlinked text and images or custom buttons!

The abandoned product block will automatically link contacts back to
their cart (or your store's generic cart page if they are not logged
into your store and click on a device other than the one they used to
build their cart), but you can also use the snippet below to link to
carts in SMS nodes or create multiple cart links in your email nodes. +
 +
To place a direct link to a Contact's abandoned checkout in hyperlinked
text and images or a button, paste the following snippet in the URL
field:

`+{% set data = trigger.getCheckout() %} {{ data.abandoned_checkout_url }} +`

If Contacts click this link on a device other than the one they built
their checkout on, they will be taken to your store's generic cart page.

=== Troubleshooting

[[immediately-unsubscribed]]
====== Why are Contacts showing as unsubscribed immediately after completing a purchase?

If your Shopify checkout page
https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/promoting-marketing/create-marketing/customer-emails#collect-customer-emails-from-the-checkout[pre-selects
the marketing email opt-in checkbox], Contacts who uncheck the marketing
email opt-in box during checkout will be unsubscribed from the
https://help.sendlane.com/article/96-how-to-integrate-shopify-and-sendlane#connecting[List
attached to your Shopify integration] as soon as checkout is complete.

[[block-unavailable]]
====== The abandoned cart block isn't available!

The abandoned cart block may not appear in your elements sidebar for two
common reasons:

. Your eCommerce integration is not set up correctly. Review your
eCommerce store's integration with Sendlane for possible connection
issues.
. You already added an abandoned cart block to your email. Only one
abandoned cart block is allowed per email.
