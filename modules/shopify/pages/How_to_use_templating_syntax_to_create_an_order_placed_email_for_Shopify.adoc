You can use templating syntax to insert dynamic data from your Shopify
store’s order placed data. Read on to learn more about templating syntax
in automation emails and see a plain text template you can use as the
basis of your order placed email.

[[prepare]]
=== Prepare your email for templating syntax with an assignment tag

The assignment tag tells the email builder how to render the templating
syntax into plain language.

Without the assignment tag, your templating syntax will not render and
will appear to contacts as raw templating syntax.

Insert assignment tag `+{% set order = trigger.getOrder() %}+` in a text
element at the very top of your email before adding one of the example
snippets so that your syntax will populate. This tag will not be visible
in emails contacts receive.

All other elements in your email must be below the text element
containing the assignment tag.

The screenshots below show a draft email with an assignment tag
correctly set, templating syntax that renders basic information about an
order, and the results of previewing the draft:

[[preview-selection]]
===== ⚠️ Previews of templating syntax pull from a randomly selected contact profile

The email builder’s preview function displays the syntax rendered as the
plain language using data from a randomly selected contact profile.

You may see some pieces of syntax “disappear” when you click Preview.
This means that the randomly selected contact did not have that data in
their profile.

For example, if you insert contacts’ billing address with templating
syntax in your email and the randomly selected contact profile does not
have a billing address, the billing address syntax will appear blank.

To force a new randomly selected contact profile, log out of Sendlane
and log in again.

[[context]]
=== Provide context for all templating syntax tags

Templating syntax returns raw data with no labels

For example, the order number tag `+{{order.name}}+` returns a raw order
number with no indication that it is an order number. If you do not
include text in your email that provides context for your templating
syntax, your email will be difficult to understand.

The table below shows the results of templating syntax with and without
manually added text to provide context:

[cols=",",]
|===
|*Templating syntax* |*Renders as*
|`+{{order.name}}+` |#1032
|Order number: `+{{order.name}}+` |Order number: #1032
|===

[[template]]
=== Basic order placed template for Shopify

You can copy and paste the entire text based template below into an
email in an automation with a Shopify Order Placed trigger and click
Preview to see dynamic data populated. When you paste the template into
the email builder, press Ctrl + Shift + V on Windows or Cmd + Shift + V
on macOS to paste without formatting.

[source,code]
----
{% set order = trigger.getOrder() %}

Order number: {{order.name}}
Order date: {{order.processed_at }}

Billing Address
{{ order.billing_address.first_name }} {{ order.billing_address.last_name }}
{{order.billing_address.address1}}
{{order.billing_address.address2}}
{{order.billing_address.city}}, {{order.billing_address.province_code}}, {{order.billing_address.zip}}
{{order.billing_address.country_code}}

Shipping Address
{{ order.shipping_address.first_name }} {{ order.shipping_address.last_name }}
{{order.shipping_address.address1}}
{{order.shipping_address.address2}}
{{order.shipping_address.city}}, {{order.shipping_address.province_code}}, {{order.shipping_address.zip}}
{{order.shipping_address.country_code}}

Order contents
{% for product in order.line_items %}

{{product.quantity}} x {{product.title}} {{product.variant_title}}

{% endfor %}

=== Advanced enhancements to the basic order placed template for Shopify

[[preview-selection]]
===== ⚠️ Product templating syntax in order or checkout automations requires a loop function to display all items in an order

If you use product related templating syntax without a loop, only one
product from the order or checkout will render in the email.

To add a loop function:

[arabic]
. Copy the following loop tag `+{% for product in order.line_items %}+`

[arabic, start=2]
. Paste the loop tag directly above the beginning of your product
related syntax

[arabic, start=3]
. Copy the following end loop tag `+{% endfor %}+`

[arabic, start=4]
. Paste the end loop tag directly below the end of your product related
syntax

For example, the syntax below will display a list containing the name of
each product in the randomly selected order or checkout used by the
email builder preview:

*Order*

....
{% for product in order.line_items %}
{{product.title}}
{% endfor %}
    
....

*Checkout*

....
{% for product in checkout.line_items %}
{{product.title}}
{% endfor %}
    
....

=== Troubleshooting

[[preview-blank]]
====== My email preview is blank!

Check for the following issues if your email containing templating
syntax is blank:

[arabic]
. Your email is missing the
https://www.notion.so/How-to-use-templating-syntax-to-create-an-order-placed-email-for-Shopify-51c2e284d6da4245bac8983b140cc697?pvs=21[assignment
tag]. Add the assignment tag to the very top of your email and click
Preview again.

[arabic, start=2]
. The preview randomly selected a profile that does not contain the data
pulled into your email. Log out of Sendlane and back in to force another
profile to be selected, and ensure that at least one order has been
placed in your Shopify store.

[[preview-blank]]
====== When I paste the sample template into the email builder, I get a `+Unexpected token "operator" of value "<"+` error

The email builder can sometimes erroneously recognize pieces of
templating syntax as URLs. If you see a
`+Unexpected token "operator" of value "<"+` error and parts of the
template appear to be links, remove the template and paste it in again
by pressing Ctrl + Shift + V on Windows or Cmd + Shift + V on macOS to
paste without formatting.
