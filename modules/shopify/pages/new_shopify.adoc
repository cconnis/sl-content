=== Shopify Integration Installation

[[log-out]]
===== üö® Being logged into Sendlane in multiple tabs or windows will cause the integration installation process to fail

Ensure you are logged into Sendlane in only ONE browser tab before
beginning the installation process. Being logged into multiple tabs will
cause¬†you to get stuck in an infinite loop between Sendlane and Shopify
without being able to finalize the installation. If this happens, delete
the Shopify integration in Sendlane and start the installation process
again.

===== üö® If you are an agency user installing Shopify, you must create a user in the target account to complete the integration process with

Agency users often run into infinite loops when trying to install
Shopify. To avoid this:

. https://help.sendlane.com/article/399-users[Create a user] in the
account you want to integrate with Shopify (use plus addressing to use
your own email address for this new account)
. Log out of your agency account
. Activate the new user account
. Log into Sendlane using the new user account
. Follow the instructions in this article to complete the Shopify
integration
. Log out of the user account
. Log into your agency account
. Delete the user you created

===== üö® Sendlane will import Contacts with ANY Shopify activity in the past 12 months; new and existing customer activity will begin syncing automatically

If you have imported Contacts into Shopify in the past 12 months, those
contacts will be included even if they have not purchased a product or
had any other activity in the past 12 months. Customer activity will
update existing Sendlane Contact records and create new Sendlane Contact
records for new customers.

Sendlane from start to finish:

====== My status is stuck at pending, but all of my Lists are assigned!

If your Shopify integration status is stuck at Pending and all Lists
have been assigned in Settings, you can always try deleting the
integrations and starting the integration process over. Sometimes, a
blip in communication between Sendlane and Shopify interrupts the
connection process. If this happens, you'll need to delete the Shopify
integration in Sendlane and the Sendlane app in Shopify.

Delete the existing Shopify integration that is stuck at Pending by
clicking the trash can icon:
