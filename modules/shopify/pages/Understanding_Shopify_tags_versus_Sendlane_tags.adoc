[[shopify-tags]]
=== Shopify tags in Sendlane

The only tags available for segmentation in Sendlane are
https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/shopify-admin/productivity-tools/using-tags#tag-types[Shopify
customer tags]. These are tags applied to customers' profiles in your
Shopify store. You cannot segment in Sendlane using product, transfer,
blog post, order, or draft order Shopify tags.

[[automations]]
==== Shopify tags in automation triggers

You can trigger an automation to start when a customer has a specified
Shopify customer tag applied to their profile in your Shopify store with
the
https://help.sendlane.com/article/648-automation-triggers-for-shopify#tag-applied[Shopify
Customer Tag Applied trigger].

This trigger cannot be used to start automations when Sendlane tags are
applied to contact profiles in Sendlane. To use a Sendlane tag to
trigger an automation, use the
https://help.sendlane.com/article/448-automation-triggers#standard[Tag
Added or Tag Removed standard automation triggers].

[[conditional-splits]]
==== Shopify tags in conditional splits

You can create a
https://help.sendlane.com/article/353-how-to-use-goals-and-conditional-splits-in-an-automation#conditional-splits[conditional
split] to send contacts down one of two paths in an automation based on
whether or not their profile in your Shopify store has or doesn't have a
specified tag.  When you select `+Shopify+` as your condition and
`+Customer+` as your resource, the `+Tag+` option refers to Shopify
customer tags:

[[segments]]
==== Shopify tags in segments

You can create segments of Sendlane contacts based on whether or not the
contact's profile in your Shopify store has or doesn't have a specified
Shopify tag. When you select `+Shopify+` as your condition and
`+Customer+` as your resource, the `+Tag+` option refers to Shopify
customer tags:
