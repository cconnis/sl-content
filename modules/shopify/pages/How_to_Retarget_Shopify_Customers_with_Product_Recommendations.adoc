=== Creating a _Recommend Similar Products_ Automation

. Begin by clicking *_Automations_* on the left of your dashboard and
clicking *_New Automation_* on the top right
. Choose the *_eCommerce_* tab within the template options and
select _*Recommend similar
products*image:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5ec78b0c2c7d3a5ea54b916f/file-CavjxS6HKp.png[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5ec78b0c2c7d3a5ea54b916f/file-CavjxS6HKp]_
+
. Once the pre-designed automation loads, click to configure
the __*Product Purchased* __trigger details:    
* _*Choose shop*:_ Choose your Shopify store from the drop down menu
* **_Checkout is complete:_ **You can choose if you wish to send this
only after checkout is completed or not
* **_Order status:_ **You have a few options to choose from, depending
on when you wish to send this email to your customers (e.g. when the
order is fulfilled, partial, restocked, etc.)
* *_Selected_:* You can choose the products that you want to trigger
this automation +

. Next, click on the *_Email_* action to edit/create the content that
you'd like to send to your customer. Follow the prompts to complete all
of the basic details, then continue along to the email design
. Inside of the _Email Builder_, if you go to _Content_, you'll see an
_Integrations_ section with a _Product_ icon

. In order for the recommended products to be added to the content of
your email, you will need to drag and drop the _Product_ icon into the
body of your email. Once you do that, a pop-up window will come up that
will allow you to edit some of the options: _the store_, _the number of
products (up to 3)_ and also if you want _Title, Price_ and _Button_ to
show up inside your email

. Once you click on *_Select Products_*, you will be prompted to
actually choose the products you wish to recommend. Once you are done,
simply click on *_Insert Products_* and that will add them to the body
of your email

. Once you have completed the content for this email, click __*Save and
Continue*. __Don't forget to hit *_Publish Email_* in the sidebar menu
once you're
finished!image:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5e9dff5b04286364bc98ace5/file-UoHBuq7hro.png[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5e9dff5b04286364bc98ace5/file-UoHBuq7hro]
. Continue building your automation by adding any other
https://help.sendlane.com/article/73-automations#communications[actions
and communications] you'd like to use. Depending on what your goals and
objectives are, we recommend sending three emails over the next few days
to encourage contacts to come back and complete a purchase.
. Last but not least, don't forget to set the automation
to _Active_ once you're done building out your
funnel!image:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5ee258aa2c7d3a10cba8c537/file-NNSNQ7H5f4.png[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5ee258aa2c7d3a10cba8c537/file-NNSNQ7H5f4]

And that's it! Anytime someone purchases these specific products, they
will trigger this automation and start receiving emails with more
product recommendations!

=== Troubleshooting

*Why are Contacts showing as unsubscribed immediately after completing a
purchase?*

****If your Shopify checkout page

the marketing email opt-in checkbox], Contacts who uncheck the marketing
