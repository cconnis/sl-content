Sendlane's Beacon is automatically built into the one-click install
BigCommerce integration, which means as soon as you install BigCommerce
you're ready to set up a browse abandonment Automation!

Browse abandonment, also known as product viewed or product abandoned,
allows you to send messages to Contacts who have viewed specified
products on your store's website and left without completing a
purchase.¬†

===== üö¶ Before Getting Started

If you installed
https://app.sendlane.com/integrations/bigcommerce[Sendlane's BigCommerce
integration] *before 6/13/22*, you will need to re-sync the integration
to install the correct Beacon code. Check out our guide to

===== üôã How Does the Beacon Pixel Work?

Sendlane‚Äôs Beacon tracking pixel collects information about your
Contacts' pageview and purchase activity.¬†For the pixel to begin
tracking, the viewer must opt into your marketing emails and then open
an email from you. The Beacon tracking pixel cannot identify anonymous
viewers.

Once tracking begins, please allow up to 24 hours for reporting to
populate accurately

=== Troubleshooting

====== The abandoned cart block isn't available!

The abandoned cart block may not appear in your elements sidebar for two
common reasons:

. Your eCommerce integration is not set up correctly. Review your
eCommerce store's integration with Sendlane for possible connection
issues.
. You already added an abandoned cart block to your email. Only one
abandoned cart block is allowed per email.

[[not-firing]]
====== A Contact abandoned a product view and move through the Automation!

through your browse abandonment Automation is that they are

Tracking requires non-anonymous browsing in order to trigger the
Automation.
