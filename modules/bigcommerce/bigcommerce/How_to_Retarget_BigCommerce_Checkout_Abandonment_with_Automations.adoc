  ===== ðŸ’¡ Use the following snippet to add a direct link to Contacts' carts in hyperlinked text, images, or custom buttons!

  To place a direct link to a Contact's abandoned checkout in
  hyperlinked text and images or a button, paste the following snippet
  in the URL field:

  `+{% set data = trigger.getCheckout() %} {{ data.checkout_data.cart_url}} +`

  If Contacts click this link on a device other than the one they built
  their checkout on, they will be taken to your store's generic cart
  page.

  We recommend adding a wait node set to 24 hours after all email nodes
  to prevent your Contacts from receiving emails too frequently.

=== Troubleshooting

====== The abandoned cart block isn't available!

The abandoned cart block may not appear in your elements sidebar for two
common reasons:

. Your eCommerce integration is not set up correctly. Review your
eCommerce store's integration with Sendlane for possible connection
issues.
. You already added an abandoned cart block to your email. Only one
abandoned cart block is allowed per email.
