The following script provides more granular control over the appearance
and settings for the back in stock notification form and button
appearing on product pages when a product is out of stock. This script
can be used in place of the simplified script in step 3.

Before logging into BigCommerce, you'll need to add your BigCommerce
integration token to the script. Copy the script to a text editor, then
replace theÂ  `+PUBLIC_TOKEN+`Â with the token in your
https://app.sendlane.com/integrations/bigcommerce[BigCommerce
