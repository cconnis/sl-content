==== Overview

Product groups allow you to group the reviews of different products
together and display reviews of all products in the group on each
individual product's page. Product groups also combine star ratings for
each included product.

If your store offers the same base product with different designs,
product groups are a great way to make sure all of the products benefit
from the reviews submitted by your customers! Read on to learn how to
create and edit product groups.
