Proceed with link:#upload-to-sendlane[uploading your .CSV into Sendlane
Reviews]!

[[yotpo-export]]
==== Uploading an Export From Yotpo

Yotpo sometimes provides different header columns based on the version
of the app being used. If header columns do not exactly match Sendlane
Reviewsâ€™ import tool, the import will fail.

Open your Yotpo file using the spreadsheet software of your choice and
compare your column headers to the table below.

[cols="",]
|===
|*Accepted Yotpo Headers* âœ…
|`+Review ID+`
|`+Review Status+`
|`+Review Title+`
|`+Review Content+`
|`+Review Score+`
|`+Review Creation Date+`
|`+Product ID+`
|`+Product Title+`
|`+Reviewer Display Name+`
|`+Reviewer Email+`
|`+Comment Content+`
|`+Comment Public+`
|`+Comment Date+`
|`+Published Image URLs+`
|===

[[yotpo-match]]
===== The headers on my Yotpo export match the accepted Yotpo headers!

If your headers exactly match the headers in the Accepted Yotpo Headers
column of the table above, awesome! Youâ€™re almost ready to proceed with
importing your reviews file. Save your file as .CSV, then proceed with
uploading your file.

[[yotpo-no-match]]
===== The headers on my Yotpo export DO NOT match the accepted Yotpo headers!

No worries! Youâ€™ll just need to replace your exportâ€™s headers before
proceeding, and add an Order ID column:

Replace any headers that do not exactly match the Accepted Yotpo Headers
column in the table above

Add a header labeled `+Order ID+` and leave the column blank

Save your file as .CSV

Once youâ€™ve completed the steps above, proceed with uploading your file.

[[stamped-export]]
==== Uploading an Export From Stamped

Stamped sometimes provides different header columns based on the version
of the app being used. If header columns do not exactly match Sendlane
Reviewsâ€™ import tool, the import will fail.

If your export from Stamped fails, get Product Management support by
contacting Sendlaneâ€™s 24/7 live Product Support or your Customer Success
Manager for assistance.

[[other-provider-export]]

[[button-gray]]
====== Why is the import reviews button grayed out?

The import button is grayed out when there is no assigned List for
Reviews in your eCommerce integration. To assign a List for Reviews:

. Navigate to the https://app.sendlane.com/integrations[integrations
page]
. Click your *eCommerce integration*
. Click the *settings* icon
. Select a List from the *reviews dropdown*
. Click *Continue*

[[stuck-at-processing]]
====== My reviews import is stuck at processing!

If the character `+\+` appears anywhere in your reviews import file,
your import may be stuck at the Processing stage. To fix this issue:

. Open your reviews file
. Press CMD/CTRL + F
. Enter `+\+`
. Delete any `+\+` symbols present in your file
. Save your reviews file
. Import your reviews file

link:#troubleshooting[Back to troubleshooting]

'''''

[[product-not-exist]]
====== How can I fix a `+The product doesn't exist in our database+` error?

Ensure that:

. Your eCommerce store's integration is synced, and
. The product ID in the row returning this error exists in your
eCommerce store

If your eCommerce integration is synced and the product ID returning the
error exists in your eCommerce store, incorrect number formatting (
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/display-numbers-in-scientific-exponential-notation-f85a96c0-18a1-4249-81c3-e934cd2aae25[scientific
notation]) may have been applied to your .CVS file's product ID column.
To fix this:

. Export your reviews from your previous provider again
. Do not alter the file in any way; applying a filter or cell formatting
may cause incorrect number formatting to be applied to the product ID
column
. Import the unaltered file to Sendlane Reviews

[[imported-not-showing-up]]
====== I imported my reviews, but they're not showing up!

Ensure that your eCommerce integration has a List selected in its
settings for Sendlane Reviews:

[[reviews-submitted-not-appearing]]
====== Reviews have been submitted via the widget on my website, but I don't see them in the Moderation tab!

installed in one store.
