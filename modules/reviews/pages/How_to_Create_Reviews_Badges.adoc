=== Add a Reviews Badge to Your Store

After you've selected a badge image, use your eCommerce store's theme
editor to upload your badge image and hyperlink it to your full page of
reviews. Since the reviews badge is a static image, styling is entirely
up to you and can be coordinated with your existing theme! Here's an
example of one way to display your reviews badge:
