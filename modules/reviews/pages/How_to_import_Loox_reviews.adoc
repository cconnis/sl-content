=== Troubleshooting

[[productid]]
====== My review file wasn't accepted!

Sometimes, Loox reviews are exported with an alternate spelling of the
Product ID column. The heading should read `+productID+` but sometimes
reads `+productid+`. If your file wasn't accepted, open the .CVS file
you exported from Loox and check for `+productid+`. If it's there,
change it to `+productID+`, save the file as .CSV, and try uploading
again. If you are still unable to get your file accepted, see

Sendlane Reviews] for next steps.

[[other-errors]]
====== My review file contains errors!

If some reviews were not imported due to an error, the Results column
will show how many reviews were not imported. Click the download icon in
the Actions column to download a file of reviews that were not imported.
