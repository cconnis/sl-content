=== Troubleshooting

[[product-file]]
====== My theme doesn't have a `+product-view.html+` file!

BigCommerce theme file names can vary across themes. Look for files with
the word "product" in the name.

[[collection-page-same-rating]]
====== My product collection pages are displaying the same score in the star widget for all products!

Changing the product value in the link:#copy-star[star widget snippet]
may solve the issue of collection pages displaying the same star rating
for all products.

Your store‚Äôs theme may not recognize the default value of `+product.id+`
because your theme assigns a different value (such as `+product+`,
`+id+`, or `+item.id+`) for your product elements.

Try replacing `+product.id+` in the star widget with `+product+`,
`+id+`, or `+item.id+`.

[[theme-variation]]
====== My theme doesn't have any of the recommended files or tags to place a widget!

Because themes vary widely, you may have to experiment with widget
placement. If you already use another reviews product, try placing your
widget scripts in the exact same spot your existing widgets were
installed in.
