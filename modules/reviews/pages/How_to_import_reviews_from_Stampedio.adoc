[[export]]
=== 1. Export reviews from Stamped.io

Stamped.io
https://stampedsupport.stamped.io/hc/en-us/articles/8839244356891-Exporting-Reviews-Checkout-Comments-or-NPS[advises
customers] to email `+support@stamped.io+` to request a full export of
all reviews.

[[export-warning]]
===== ‚ö†Ô∏è You must explicitly request that your export file include product IDs and photo file names

Customers sometimes receive export files without product ID or customer
review photo link columns, or those columns may be included with a
potential litany of issues.

When you email Stamped.io, include a note that your export file must
contain columns for product IDs and photos, and the photos column should
only include customer review photos, not product images.

When your file is ready for download, save it somewhere easily
accessible, like your desktop, and make sure it is saved as a .CSV file.

[[format]]
=== 2. Format Stamped.io reviews file

Exports from Stamped.io vary in their structure and content. Review your
Stamped.io export file for the following potential issues that need to
be fixed before proceeding with importing:

* link:#column-headers[Incorrect or missing column headers]
* link:#photo-file-structure[Incorrect photo column file structure]
* link:#reply-status[Review replies with a status of FALSE]
* link:#review-status[Incorrect review publication column values]

[[column-headers]]
==== Incorrect or missing column headers

Open your Stamped.io export and
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LkjMbzuMw9VjN929OQwfzgPhhkeYcSvpz0cqbrTXq4s/edit#gid=0[this
Stamped.io template]. If you import a file with column headers that the
Sendlane Reviews import tool doesn't recognize, or column headers that
the Sendlane Reviews import tool expects to find are not there, your
file will not import.

Make sure that the column headers in your export exactly match the
headers in the template. If you see any variations, such as createdat
instead of created_at, copy the column header from the template file and
paste it in your export's equivalent column header.¬†The column headers
highlighted in green in the template are columns with multiple known
Stamped.io export variations.

If you see any column headers in the template that are missing from your
export file, add them to your export file by copying the column header
from the template and pasting it into the column header to the right of
your file's last column header. `+photoFilenames+` is a common missing
header.

[[photo-file-structure]]
==== Incorrect photo column file structure

The `+photoFilenames+` column should contain the photo's file name (a
long string containing letters and numbers) and end in `+.jpg+`, like
this: `+66389_8374587636_3ffbdgs876234_8hs7_72389.jpg+`.¬†If you see any
other file structure you will need to edit each row that deviates from
the standard photo file naming convention.

Review the following table for what to do for each photo file structure:

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|===
|*`+photoFilenames+` example entries* |*Next steps*

|`+66389_8374587636_3ffbdgs876234_8hs7_72389.jpg+` |Nothing, this is the
standard file structure containing only the file's name (
`+66389_8374587636_3ffbdgs876234_8hs7_72389+`) and extension (`+.jpg+`)
ü•≥

|`+https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/stamped.io/uploads/productImages/17761_75874444675.jpg+`
|Photo file URLs beginning with
https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/stamped.io/uploads are sometimes
https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/products/product-media/add-media[product
photos], not photos submitted by reviewers. To find all instances of
product photos in your export file, filter the photoFilenames column and
enter¬†https. Click on each image link to determine whether it is a
product photo or a customer review photo. +
 +
If you find rows with product images but you believe the review should
have a customer submitted photo, you can ask Stamped.io to re-do your
export and note the rows containing product photos instead of customer
photos. Delete any instances of product photos that Stamped.io is not
able to replace with customer review photos.¬†If Stamped.io doesn't
provide the customer review photo URLs and you don't delete links to
product photos, product photos will appear attached to your reviews. +
 +
If you find rows with clickable links that lead to customer review
photos you'll need to remove part of the URL so that you're left with
the file name and `+.jpg+` extension, as shown in the column to the
left. Using the example in the column to the left, you would open your
spreadsheet software's search and replace function, enter
`+https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/stamped.io/uploads/productImages/+`,
and select replace all, which would return `+17761_75874444675.jpg +`for
our example. Because the photo URL column in Stamped.io exports varies,
you will need to copy the portion of a URL in your export file ending
with the leftmost / for your search and replace. +

|`+NULL+` |If you believe the review should have a customer submitted
photo, you can ask Stamped.io to re-do your export and note the rows
containing `+NULL+` instead of customer photos. +
 +
You can also delete any instances of `+NULL+` and proceed with reviewing
your file and uploading to Sendlane.

|`+126999_6566237012064_4d5967_38b8_49e6_aaf1_5e4fcb823aef.jpg, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/stamped.io/uploads/videos/54ff3dc60e17968b089f6ac27e3135.mp4#t=0.1+`
|Customers sometimes include a photo and video in their review. Sendlane
Reviews does not support video files yet, so any URL containing a
`+.mp4+` extension must be removed. If you see a row with an example
like the one in the column to the left, delete the entire URL containing
the `+.mp4+` extension so that you are left with only the photo:
`+126999_6566237012064_4d5967_38b8_49e6_aaf1_5e4fcb823aef.jpg+`

[[reply-status]]
==== Review replies with a status of `+FALSE+`

The Stamped.io export includes a column called `+verified+` which
indicates the status of a reply; `+TRUE +`means published and `+FALSE+`
means unpublished or deleted. The Sendlane Reviews import tool does not
look at this column. All replies are imported and publicly available.

If you want to prevent unpublished or deleted review replies from being
published in your Sendlane Reviews widget, filter the
`+verified+`¬†column for `+FALSE+`¬†and delete the reply in the `+reply+`
column.

[[review-status]]
==== Incorrect review publication column values

Stamped.io exports can contain multiple variations of publication
statuses in the published column indicating whether a review should
appear on your website or not. Variations include, but are not limited
to, `+TRUE +`/`+FALSE+`, `+Published+`/`+Unpublished+`,
`+published+`/`+unpublished+`, `+1+`/`+2+`, and `+0+`/`+1+`. The
Sendlane Reviews import tool accepts `+TRUE +`/`+FALSE+` (case
insensitive) or `+published+`/`+unpublished+` (case sensitive.) If your
published column contains variations, use your spreadsheet tool's find
and replace functionality to replace the variation with its accepted
value.

For example, if your published column contains Published/Unpublished,
you can search for the word Published and replace it with `+TRUE+`, then
search for the word Unpublished and replace it with `+FALSE+`.
