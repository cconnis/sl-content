=== Google Shopping Review Requirements

Google maintains strict requirements for participation in its Product
Ratings program. Read the entire
https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/6098512?hl=en&ref_topic=7307120[policy
document] carefully, and make special note of the following
requirements:

* *Review volume*: Your store must have at least 50 product reviews.
Your application will be rejected if your store has fewer than 50
product reviews. Set up an
https://help.sendlane.com/article/553-review-request-automation[Automation
to request reviews] from your purchasers if you haven‚Äôt already!
* *Review sync frequency*: Google requires you to provide them with at
least monthly updates of your review feed, which is an XML URL similar
to an RSS feed. When you add your XML URL to your Google Merchant
Center, you‚Äôll select a frequency for the XML URL to refresh. We
recommend selecting a refresh rate of daily to keep your reviews as up
to date as possible.
* [#content-rules]#*Review content*: Google reserves the right to
‚Äúremove reviews or block entire fields that violate

not accepted by Google and will not be displayed or included in average
star rating calculations.#
