=== Troubleshooting

[[row]]
====== My review file wasn't accepted!

Sometimes, Okendo reviews are exported with an extra row at the top of
the file that says Okendo in cell A1. If your file wasn't accepted, open
the .CVS file you exported from Okendo and check for this extra line. If
it's there, delete the entire row , save the file as .CSV, and try
uploading again. If you are still unable to get your file accepted, see
https://help.sendlane.com/article/647-troubleshooting-sendlane-reviews-imports[Troubleshooting
Sendlane Reviews] for next steps.

[[other-errors]]
====== My review file contains errors!

If some reviews were not imported due to an error, the Results column
will show how many reviews were not imported. Click the download icon in
the Actions column to download a file of reviews that were not imported.
