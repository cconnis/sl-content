  Timing is critical when requesting product reviews, and wait nodes are
  here to help!
  +
  If your request arrives too early, customers might forget about it by
  the time they‚Äôve formed their opinion of your product. If it arrives
  too late, customers may have lost motivation or momentum.
  +
  We recommend using a wait node of *at least seven days* after the
  Automation‚Äôs trigger.
  +
  You may want to adjust this timing based on factors that affect your
  customers‚Äô shopping, purchasing, and product experience like average
  processing and/or shipping times.
  +
  Keep the following questions in mind when setting up wait nodes.
  +
  * *How quickly do customers receive their product?* Buffer your review
  request timing with enough time for customers to have received their
  order.
  * *Do customers see results from your product immediately or after
  extended use?* For example, if you sell candy, customers are likely to
  try a piece soon after delivery and form an opinion immediately.
  However, if you sell skin care products, customers may try the product
  immediately but won‚Äôt form an opinion until they‚Äôve used the product
  for a few weeks or even months.
  +
  To add a wait node:
  +
  . Click the *+ button*
  . Click *Wait*
  . Enter the number of days to wait

  [[review-block]]
  ==== Add a Review Block
  +
  The review block will automatically pull in the highest priced
  purchased product‚Äôs image, description, and direct link to the
  product‚Äôs review form. Use the Display, Content, and Styles tabs to
  customize the look of the review block:
  +
  * Display - Change the block's layout orientation and image size
  * Content - Rearrange the product image, name, and review link button
  styling and text
  * Styles - Adjust styling for the block background and spacing, font,
  and color options
  +
  We recommend keeping your review request emails simple with the review
  request as the only call to action.¬†Here's some sample copy for
  inspiration:
  +
  ====== Subject
  +
  What do you think of your purchase from `+Company Name+`?
  +
  ====== Body
  +
  Hello `+{{ contact.first_name | default('Friend') }}+`! Thank you so
  much for shopping at `+Company Name+`. We'd love to hear what you
  think about your new product!
  +
  ===== üôã How do I link to the review submission page without using the review block?

  Automations using the Order Placed (not Product Purchased) trigger can
  link directly to the review submission page by
  entering¬†`+trigger.getOrder.review_request_link+` as the URL for any
  hyperlinked images or text.

5::
  Some customers will inevitably miss your initial request for product
  reviews, or perhaps they hadn‚Äôt had enough time to use your product
  when the initial request was sent. Add additional nodes to your review
  request Automation to serve as reminders.
  +
  [[wait2]]
  ==== Add Another Wait Node
  +
  Make sure to provide enough time between the initial request and the
  reminder for customers to become familiar with your product and to not
  feel rushed.
  +
  We recommend at least seven days between the initial request and a
  reminder.
  +
  [[split]]
  ==== Add a Conditional Split
  +
  Before adding additional reminders, add a Conditional Split to avoid
  requesting a review that has already been submitted.
  +
  To add a Conditional Split:
  +
  . Click the *+ button*
  . Click *Conditional Split*
  . Set conditions:
  .. Reviews > Submitted Review > Recent > Set the same length of time
  as the wait node
  . Click
  *Done*image:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/6491d85f5fc2fe6b6dc6055e/file-Wu3NCjeylh.gif[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/6491d85f5fc2fe6b6dc6055e/file-Wu3NCjeylh]
  +

  Add an email under the No branch of the Conditional Split to send
  reminder emails to Contacts who did not submit a review during the
  wait time:
  +
  . Click the *+ button* under the No branch of the Conditional Split
  . Click *Send Message*
