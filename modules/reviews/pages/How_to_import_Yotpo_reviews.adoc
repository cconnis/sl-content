=== 1. Export reviews from Yotpo

Follow https://support.yotpo.com/docs/exporting-reviews-from-yotpo[these
instructions] for exporting your product reviews from Yotpo. When your
file is ready for download, save it somewhere easily accessible, like

=== 2. Ensure your reviews file from Yotpo is formatted correctly

Yotpo sometimes provides different header columns based on the version
of the app being used. If header columns do not exactly match Sendlane
Reviews’ import tool, the import will fail.

Open your Yotpo file using the spreadsheet software of your choice and
compare your column headers to the table below.

[cols=",",]
|===
|Accepted Yotpo Headers ✅ |Yotpo Header Variations ⚠️
|`+Review ID+` |id
|`+Review Status+` |published
|`+Review Title+` |review_title
|`+Review Content+` |review_content

===== The headers on my Yotpo export match the accepted Yotpo headers!

If your headers exactly match the headers in the Accepted Yotpo Headers
column of the table above, awesome! You’re almost ready to proceed with
importing your reviews file. Save your file as .CSV, then proceed with
uploading your file.

===== The headers on my Yotpo export DO NOT match the accepted Yotpo headers!

No worries! You’ll need to replace your export’s headers and add an
Order ID column before proceeding:

. Replace any headers that do not exactly match the Accepted Yotpo
Headers column in the table above
. Add a header labeled `+Order ID+` and leave the column blank
. Save your file as .CSV

Once you’ve completed the steps above, proceed with uploading your file.
