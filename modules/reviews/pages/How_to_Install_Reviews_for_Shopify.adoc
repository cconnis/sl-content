1::
  The reviews widget script connects your Shopify store to your Sendlane
  account. To install the widget script:
  +
  . Login to Shopify
  . Click *Sales Channels*
  . Click *Online Store*
  . Click *Themes*
  . Click the *three dot menu*
  . Click *Edit code*
  . Search for the `+theme.liquid+` file
  . Click into the file
  . Press CTRL + F
  . Enter `+</head>+`
  . Paste the widget script on the line before the `+</head>+` tag
  . Click *Save*
2::
  The reviews widget element tells your Shopify store where to display
  reviews for individual products on your product pages. You can install
  the widget element in the default product page template file, and
  Sendlane Reviews will automatically only display reviews for the
  product that appears on the page. +
   +
  To install the main review widget:
  +
  . Copy the Widget Element code from the reviews page in Sendlane
  . Login to Shopify
  . Click *Sales Channels*
  . Click *Online Store*
  . Click *Themes*
  . Click *Customize*
  . From the dropdown at the top center of the screen, select *Products*
  . Click *Default product,* or the custom template you use as your
  default product page
  . Click *Add section* wherever you'd like the Reviews widget to appear
  (generally, this is¬†installed at the bottom of the product page; use
  the preview button to see your widget's placement and make adjustments
  as needed)
  . Select *Custom Liquid* (if you don‚Äôt see Custom Liquid as an option,
  follow
  https://help.sendlane.com/article/578-how-to-create-a-custom-liquid-block-option-for-your-shopify-theme[these
  instructions])
  . Paste the widget element code in the Custom Liquid field
  . Click *Save*
  . If you use more than one product page template, repeat steps 1-11
  for each product page
  templateimage:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/65ea4277b4dc640d457db4e8/file-061Ms0Iw7r.gif[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/65ea4277b4dc640d457db4e8/file-061Ms0Iw7r]
  +
  To check that the review script and widget were installed correctly,
  click Preview Store, then click on a product and scroll down.
  +
  If you‚Äôve imported reviews, you should see any existing reviews for
  the product you clicked on.
  +
  If you have not imported reviews, you should see a section to write
  the first review for the product you clicked on.
  +
  ===== üôã How do I fix a reviews widget that is too wide?

  If a full-width reviews widget conflicts with your store's design, you
  can use the div classes below, surrounding the widget element snippet,
  to reduce the widget's width to match the rest of your website's
  content.¬†Try the second option if the first option doesn't fix your
  widget's width.

  Option 1: `+<div class="page-width"> </div>+`. To implement this
  option, replace the snippet you pasted into the Custom Liquid block in
  step 10 above with the following:

....
<div class="page-width">
    <div class="sendlane-reviews" sl-product-id="{{product.id}}"></div>
</div>
....

  Option 2: `+<div class="shopify-section"> </div>+`. To implement this
  option, replace the snippet you pasted into the Custom Liquid block in
  step 10 above with the following:

....
<div class="shopify-section">
    <div class="sendlane-reviews" sl-product-id="{{product.id}}"></div>
</div>
....

  The star rating widget element displays a product‚Äôs average star
  rating on individual product pages and on product collection pages.

  +
  *If you don't see an "Add Section" option, see the video below about
  using the Chrome inspect tool and your theme's files to install your
  star rating widget
  +
  [[product-page-collections]]
  ==== Product Collection Pages
  +
  The process for installing the star rating widget varies widely by
  Shopify theme and can require experimentation. We highly recommend
  that your store's webmaster complete this process. If you have
  migrated to Sendlane Reviews from another reviews platform, we highly
  suggest that you install the Sendlane Reviews product collection star
  rating widget in the same place as your existing star rating widget.
  +
  . Login to Shopify
  . Click *Sales Channels*
  . Click *Online Store*
  . Click the¬†*three dot menu*
  . Click *Edit code*
  +
  From here, you must search for the correct product collection file by
  identifying key characteristics that indicate you are in the correct
  file. Usually, only one product collection file will contain both
  titles and prices, and these files are usually named
  `+product-card.liquid+`, `+card-product.liquid+`, or
  `+product-card-grid.liquid+`, depending on your Shopify store's theme.
  +
  Determine whether you've found the correct file by clicking into the
  file, pressing CTRL + F, and searching for `+price+` and `+title+`.
  You'll find both in the correct file. If your theme does not have
  `+product-card.liquid+`, `+card-product.liquid+`, or
  `+product-card-grid.liquid+` files, try files with the words product,
  collection, card, or grid in their name.
  +
  You'll likely need to try pasting the star rating widget code in a few
  different locations before you find the right place. You can use
  Chrome's inspect tool to help you narrow down a location. Watch the
  video below for a demonstration of using the inspect tool to identify
  the right place for the star rating widget.

  +
  ===== üôã ¬†How can I change the styling of the star rating widget?

  . Open the Custom Liquid block or Liquid file where your star widget
  is installed
  . Copy the following snippet:
  * {blank}
  +
....
.slr-widget--mini {
    margin-top: 0px;
    margin-bottom: 0px;
  }
  
  .slr-widget--mini .slr-stars svg {
    width: 20px;
    height: 20px;
  }
  .slr-widget--mini .slr-stars-score__total {
    font-size: 8px;
    color: black;
    font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;

  }
....
  . Paste the snippet directly above the star rating widget snippet
  . Adjust the values for each property
  .. `+margin-top+`: Adds a margin above the star widget
  .. `+margin-bottom+`:¬†Adds a margin below the star widget
  .. `+width+` and `+height+`: Determine the width and height of the
  widget and should always be the same number
  .. `+font-size+`: Determines the size of the font
  .. `+color+`: Determines the color of the font
  .. `+font-family+`: Determines the family of fonts and order of fonts
  to display
  . Click *Save*
  . Review your changes by clicking *Preview*

=== Troubleshooting

[[widgets-not-appearing]]
====== The widgets aren't appearing on all pages

The widget element and star widget element must be installed separately
on every product page or collection template you want them to appear on.
Check that the product page you expect to see an element on contains the
installation snippet.
