offensive content. This includes content that is harassing, libelous,
abusive, profane, obscene, sexually explicit, or discriminatory.

concerned with the specified product or store.
* *Contains personal information*Â - Review contains confidential or
private information.
* *Foreign language*Â - Review is written in a language other than the
language the store operates in.
* *Legal transgression* - Review content contains information that
cannot legally be published, such as an individualâ€™s medical, financial,
or other protected information; a companyâ€™s trade secrets; or any other
unlawful information.
* *Spam or contains advertising* - Review advertises another product or
service
* *False or misleading* - Review contains information or claims that are
