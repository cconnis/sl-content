=== Troubleshooting

[[product-details]]
====== My theme doesn't have a `+ProductDetails.html+` file!

BigCommerce theme file names can vary across themes. Look for files with
the word "product" in the name.

[[theme-variation]]
====== My theme doesn't have any of the recommended files or tags to place a widget!

Because themes vary widely, you may have to experiment with widget
placement. If you already use another reviews product, try placing your
widget scripts in the exact same spot your existing widgets were
installed in.
