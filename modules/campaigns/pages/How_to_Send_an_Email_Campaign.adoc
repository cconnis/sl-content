==== Overview

Email campaigns are one-time, broadcast-style emails you can use to send
newsletters, updates, announcements, or any other type of marketing
content to your audience. Campaigns are great for¬†sale/special offer,
date, or event-specific content.

If you want to send content based on¬†a contact's behavior and
preferences, check out our guide to

https://help.sendlane.com/article/499-sendlanes-new-email-builder[guide
to Sendlane's email builder] for details about everything you can
achieve with our MJML drag-and-drop email builder.

Sendlane has https://www.sendlane.com/resources[many resources] to help
clarify a winning marketing strategy for your brand! Check out our blog
https://www.sendlane.com/blog/email-design-tips[6 Email Design Tips to
Increase Engagement] for tips on creating a style guide for your brand,
optimizing for mobile devices, personalization, color psychology, and
call-to-action best practices.

In addition to design resources, consult content resources that focus on
how content can affect deliverability, such as
https://help.sendlane.com/article/356-spam-folder[Why is my email going
to the spam folder?]

Here are a few simple rules that can help your email reach as many
contacts as possible:

* *Emails should be 40% images at most*.¬†Some inbox providers block
automatic image downloading which means contacts who use those services
will not immediately see any images in your email. Images are also not
readable by screen readers. Use text or buttons whenever possible!
* *Content order matters*.¬†contacts see the top of your email first; if
the first sections don't grab them, they likely won't continue
scrolling. Keep logo images and generic brand information at the top of
an email as small as possible while still being readable, or consider
moving it to the bottom of the email.
* *Use one call-to-action per email*.¬†When emails have multiple
calls-to-action, contacts aren't sure which is the most important. Keep
your content focused and concise so contacts can easily scan it!

Click *Next to Summary*¬†to continue to the campaign Summary page.

summary of campaign content and settings on the Schedule & Summary page.

Select a sending method from the radio buttons under the Schedule
heading:

[cols=",",]
|===
|*Save as Draft* |Use the Save as Draft option to save a draft of your
campaign for later. When you're ready to send, find your campaign on the
https://app.sendlane.com/campaigns[campaigns page], then click through
to the Schedule page.

|*Send Immediately* |Use the Send Immediately option to send your
campaign to your contacts as soon as you click Send.

|*Schedule* |Use the Schedule option to specify a time in the future to
send your campaign
|===

[[timezone]]
===== Time zone options for scheduled campaigns

You can schedule a campaign to send to all contacts simultaneously or at
a specified time in their local time zone. For example, if you schedule
a campaign to send at 9 AM your time (EST), contacts will receive the
campaign at whatever time 9 AM EST is in their time zone.

Contacts' time zones are determined by the following attributes in the
following order:

. Combination of the ZIP code or province and country shown on the
contact profile
. Contact's phone number area code
. Contact's IP address (set by their latest click on a tracking link)
. Country shown on the contact profile

The campaign will be sent in the account's local timezone if none of the
above attributes are available.

To send a campaign to all recipients at the same time in a specified
time zone, select a time zone from the Time zone dropdown¬†(your
account's time zone is noted as Default) and set your preferred time:

image:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/669e946838e94c7683947166/file-5bdHCXM1Wp.png[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/669e946838e94c7683947166/file-5bdHCXM1Wp]

To send a campaign to recipients at a specified time in their local time
zone, select Recipient's Local Time zone from the Time zone dropdown and
set your preferred time:

image:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/669e949fea04c5571255668c/file-ZoDCObaiHp.png[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/669e949fea04c5571255668c/file-ZoDCObaiHp]

When you schedule campaigns to send at recipients' local time, you'll
see a note informing you when the campaign will begin to send. This time
is the first instance of the specified time for all time zones
represented in your campaign's audience. Campaigns sent at recipients'
local time may have a Sending status for up to 24 hours.

=== Troubleshooting

[[blank]]
====== My contacts are seeing blank emails!¬†

The campaign likely used one image as the entire email. contacts may be
seeing the image because they have not downloaded or allowed images in
their inbox settings, or they are receiving the¬†plain
text-only¬†format¬†of an email that has no text inside. Best practices
suggest a ratio of 60% text and 40% images.

[[rate-over-100]]
====== Why is the click or open rate >100% on the Campaigns page?

Metrics on the Campaign page show total click rate and total open rate.
Click on the Campaign report to view the unique click rate and unique
open rate.
