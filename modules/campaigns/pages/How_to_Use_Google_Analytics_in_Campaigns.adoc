Google Analytics gives you a simple way to measure the effectiveness of
your email marketing campaigns through a full picture of your contact's
activity. 

If you are already using Google Analytics on your website, you have the
ability to enable Google Analytics tracking links automatically in your
Sendlane campaigns!

=== Before Getting Started

Please be sure that you already have Google Analytics setup with your
website.

If you don't already have Google Analytics in place, or you would like
to start using Google Analytics for your website, you can get more
information and sign up for a free account

. Click *_Next_* to continue designing the rest of your campaign's
message then *Save and Continue* to move on
. Once you schedule your campaign, any links that you add in your
campaign will be tracked by Google Analytics
+
====== Please Note

Only links that direct to pages on your website that have the Google
Analytics script installed will be tracked by Google Analytics
+
When you view your campaign in Google Analytics, the Source will be
'newsletter', the Medium will be 'email', and the Campaign will be the
title you entered

=== Advanced Google Analytics Tracking

If you want to fully customize the campaign parameters in your links,
you will need to use custom UTM (Urchin Tracking Module) tracking. 

You can learn more about UTMs and custom URLs from the Google Analytics
link:%20https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033863?hl=en[Help
Center].

Once you are ready to set up your custom UTM tracking link, you can use
https://ga-dev-tools.appspot.com/campaign-url-builder/[Google's URL
Builder] which will generate a custom campaign URL that you can add to
the links in your campaigns. 

====== Please Note

If you are using a custom URL you need to toggle the Sendlane Google
Analytics off - the custom URL will be used instead. If you combine
Sendlane's Google Analytics with custom UTM tracking, the reporting may
be incorrect. We highly recommend only using *one* type of Google
Analytics tracking.

'''''

=== Troubleshooting

* Make sure you have the Google Analytics script installed in your
website where you are linking your URLs to
* New Google Analytics accounts may take a few days to start populating
data
* Your Google Analytics account has to be set up and configured
*_before_* you send out your campaign; Google Analytics doesn't work
retroactively

===== Custom URLs

* You can test your Custom UTM link by copying and pasting the URL you
created into your web browser's address bar and pressing enter. If your
link is set up properly you should see a record of this visit in your
Google Analytics account
* Any link you create cannot contain spaces
* The server of your website has to be able to process the parameters in
the link, if not you will receive a 404 error
