Machine Learning Open PredictabilityÂ (MLOP) helps you send Campaigns
when Contacts are most likely to open and click based on their past
behavior.

When MLOP is enabled, Sendlane uses behavior tracking to analyze the
activity patterns and habits of every Contact in your Campaign's
audience. This data is used to send out Campaigns at the most optimal
time for each Contact within the 24 hour window after the Campaign is
sent. Contacts with little or no data will receive the Campaign when it
is sent.

===== ðŸš¦ Before Getting Started

Because MLOP relies on Contacts' activity to determine when to send the
Campaign, we recommend waiting to use MLOP until you have sent multiple
Campaigns to give your account enough time to collect activity data.

===== ðŸš¨ Don't use Experiments and MLOP together

Because MLOP sends a Campaign to each audience member at a different
time, enabling MLOP while using
https://help.sendlane.com/article/370-campaign-experiments[Experiments]
means that there are fewer Contacts available to interact with the
Campaign before a winner is chosen.

===== ðŸš¨ Contacts without activity data in their profiles will receive the Campaign immediately

MLOP relies on a Contact's average activity data to determine the best
time for them to receive your Campaign. If a Contact is new to your
audience and does not have activity data recorded yet, they will receive
a Campaign with MLOP enabled immediately when the Campaign is sent.

=== Troubleshooting

====== My campaign is stuck in "Sending"!

Campaigns with MLOP enabled will show as Sending for the entire 24 hour
sending window.

====== *I enabled MLOP but my Campaign sent to all my Contacts immediately!*

Campaigns with MLOP enabled will send immediately to any Contact without
sufficient behavior tracking data associated with their Contact Profile.
