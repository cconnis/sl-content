Tags are labels that are assigned to Contacts based on their unique
interests, activity and behavior. Tags help create granular collections
of Contacts for highly targeted content!

Follow along with this guide to Tags and check out the Additional

[[tag-contacts]]
=== Tag Contacts Manually

* Tag Contacts While Importing
* Tag Manually Added Contacts

[[tag-imported]]
==== Tag Contacts While Importing

During the Contact import process, you can easily apply an existing Tag
to all contacts within your import file using the Tags field in the
import window!

[[import-warning]]
===== ðŸš¨ Applying Tag(s) while importing will Tag every Contact in the import file

To apply Tags only to certain imported Contacts, split each group of
Contacts into its own file and import the files separately.

image:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/64c833153aabb03ecd7e650b/file-ZdKhPdFtS6.png[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/64c833153aabb03ecd7e650b/file-ZdKhPdFtS6]

==== Tag Lists

Adding a Tag to a List allows you to add a specified Tag to all Contacts
currently on the List. Contacts later added to the same List will not
automatically have the Tag applied.

. Select the List you'd like to Tag
. Click *Tag*
. Select a *Tag* from the dropdown
. Click *Add*

[[tag-automation]]
=== Tag Contacts in Automations

Using the Add Tag function within an Automation allows you to add tags
based on Contact behavior such as opening an email or clicking a link,
while the Contact moves through your Automation.

===== ðŸš¨ Any Automation action created after a Contact has already started the Automation sequence will not affect that Contact

For example, if a Contact subscribed to your List yesterday and you
create an "Add Tag" function in your welcome Automation today (even if
the contact has not reached this point in automation yet), the Tag will
not be added to that Contact.

To add a Tag action to your Automation:

. Open the Automation and click the black *+ button*Â to add an Update
Contact Property step
. Select *Update Property Contact* from the Actions menu in the
left-hand sidebar
. Select *Add Tag*
. Select an *existing Tag* from the Select Tag dropdown or click the
pink *Create New Tag* button to create a new Tag for the Automation.

[[add-tag-to-new-contacts]]
==== Add a Tag to New Contacts

Use an Add Tag action right after a Subscribes to a list trigger to tag
a contact as soon as they are added to a List:

conditions within the Automation.

=== Troubleshooting

[[tag-segment]]
====== How do I add a Tag to a Segment?

It is not possible to apply a Tag to a Segment. Since Segments are
dynamic, Contacts move in and out of them and there isn't a
straightforward way to later remove a Tag that is based on the behavior
or status qualified the Contact to be included in the Segment.

If you'd like to

a List from a Segment], you can then link:#tag-lists[add a Tag to the
newly created List]!
