[[generate]]
=== ¬†Generate coupon codes

Use the tool of your choice to generate unique coupon codes and save
your file as a .CSV (maximum size 100 MB).

We recommend¬†generating enough codes for all contacts who will receive
the campaign or automation message. For campaigns, generate slightly
more coupons than the campaign builder's audience estimation. We
recommend around 50k codes for high volume automations.

We recommend the following coupon generation tools:

* BigCommerce -

[[format]]
=== ¬†Format coupon code file

Coupon collection .CSV files should:

Be 100 MB or smaller (this generally translates to around 50,000 codes
as long as the file has no other columns)

Contain a single column with a header that does not contain spaces (for
example:¬†`+couponcode+` will import, `+coupon code+` will not)

Contain a unique coupon code in every row
