[[personalization-styling]]
====== ðŸ™‹ How do I change the font styling for an inserted personalization?

When you select a Custom Field or templating syntax personalization from
a dropdown, the syntax is inserted into the email as a snippet with
protections that help avoid breaking the syntax.

To change the styling of an inserted syntax snippet:

. Use your cursor to select the snippet (you may need to select the
space just before and after the snippet)
. Paste the snippet somewhere else to remove the formatting by pressing
`+CMD+`+ `+Shift+` + `+V+`
. Copy the snippet from where it was pasted in the previous step
. Paste the snippet back into your email
. Format the text as normal

Previewing a coupon code will not use a code, but sending a test email
will. Check out our guide to

=== Troubleshooting

[[stopped]]
====== Why did my campaign stop sending?

If your coupon collection does not have enough coupon codes left to send
to each contact in the campaign's audience, the campaign will not go out
to any contacts. Replenish your coupon collection and send the campaign
again. +
