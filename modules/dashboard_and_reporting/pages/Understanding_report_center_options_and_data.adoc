[[cache]]
===== ⚠️ Report center data is not real time

Report center reports rely on a cached copy of the Sendlane database to
generate reports quickly, typically in under a minute or so. Cached
versions of reports ensure that reports can be generated and downloaded
quickly but might result in an older snapshot of your data. The
information in your report may be between one and four hours behind real
time.

[[rate-metrics]]
===== ⚠️ Rate metrics are percentages but may not be automatically recognized as such by your spreadsheet software

Metrics with `+rate+` in their name are percentages. If a `+rate+`
metric looks suspiciously low on your report export, ensure the column
is set to percentage
