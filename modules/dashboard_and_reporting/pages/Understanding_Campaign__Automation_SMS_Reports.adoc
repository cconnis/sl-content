Campaign and Automation emails automatically generate reports showing
the email's performance, including what time of day received the most
opens and which links got the most clicks. Regularly reviewing email
reports can help direct your marketing strategy towards what works!

===== ðŸš¦ Before Getting Started

To give your Contacts enough time to engage with your email, we
recommend waiting at least 24 hours after Campaign emails go out and 1-3
days after Automations are activated to review email reports
