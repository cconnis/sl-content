=== Troubleshooting

[[#error]]
====== How do I fix a server error?

Server errors are likely due to one of the following issues:

. The Facebook account that was used to integrate with Sendlane has not
accepted the terms of service for Facebook Custom Audiences. Log in to
the Facebook account that was used to connect with Sendlane and accept
the https://www.facebook.com/ads/manage/customaudiences/tos/[terms of
service].
. The Facebook account that was used to integrate with Sendlane was
given read-only access to the Facebook business account. Provide full
access to the Facebook account used to manage the Facebook Custom
Audience.
. You have reached or exceeded Facebook's limit of 500 or more
audiences. You can make room in your account by
https://www.facebook.com/business/help/164749007013531?id=401668390442328[creating
lookalike audiences] for other audiences, but be aware that lookalike
audiences will not sync with Sendlane.
