https://createform.com/[CreateForm] is an online form builder that
allows you to create beautiful forms with no coding required.

By integrating CreateForm with Sendlane, leads collected by your forms
can be funneled directly to your Lists in Sendlane.

'''''

=== Before Getting Started

Prior to connecting with Sendlane, you'll need an active
https://createform.com/[CreateForm account] with a form created.

Please also have your
https://help.sendlane.com/article/71-how-to-find-your-api-key-api-hash-key-and-subdomain[Sendlane
API Key&#44; Hash Key and Subdomain] ready. These can be found in your
Sendlane account under *_Account_* → *_API_*.

Last (but not least) be sure you have
https://help.sendlane.com/article/125-creating-a-list[created a list]
inside of your Sendlane account, so CreateForm knows where to place your
new leads and contacts!
