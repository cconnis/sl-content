incite actions throughout your entire funnel.

=== Before Getting Started

Prior to connecting with Sendlane, you'll need an active
https://www.deadlinefunnel.com/?lmref=XRFNfw[Deadline Funnel account]. 

You will also need a Sendlane
https://help.sendlane.com/article/73-automations[automation] created.
Deadline Funnel will connect with Sendlane via a step within your
automation that triggers the Deadline Funnel campaign.

=== Connecting Deadline Funnel and Sendlane

. First, create your Deadline Funnel campaign
. Visit the *_API Integrations_* area of Deadline Funnels and click
*_Add A New Integration_*

. Select *_Sendlane_* from the integration options and click the webhook
link generated to copy it

. Within your Sendlane Automation that you'd like to use to trigger this
Deadline Funnel campaign, add a *_Webhook_* step to indicate _when_ the
Deadline Funnel should be triggered
+

. Paste the link that was copied from Deadline Funnel, and change the
method from *_GET_* to *_POST_*

. Finish building your automation, and set it to *_Active_* 

And that's it! 

Once the integration is up and running, any contact who goes through
your automation will start their Deadline Funnel tracking as soon as
they reach the Webhook in your automation!

=== Next Steps

Be sure to add the Deadline Funnel email links to the emails you create
within your automation (wherever you're linking to a page that has a
Deadline Funnel timer or redirect on it).
