LeadsTunnel is a Facebook advertising automation platform that allows
you to connect and sync leads collected in Facebook Ads Manager to
Sendlane.

With this integration, you can sync contacts from Facebook leads ads
into specific lists in Sendlane, and then send those leads through an
automated marketing funnel!
