=== TroubleshootingÂ Â 

===== Response Code 422

If you are seeing a response code 422 after testing, there is an unsaved
step in your integration. Please review _all_ steps, making sure to save
at _every_ opportunity. Take extra care toÂ copy _and then_*Â save* your
IPN in Sendlane before proceeding to Clickbank to *save* __and
thenÂ __test.Â 

===== image:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5f9b2a5c4cedfd0016107e40/testing_IPN-2.png[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5f9b2a5c4cedfd0016107e40/testing_IPN-2]The integration is connected in Sendlane, but data isn't being passed

Please be sure you've clicked *_Save_* in every step on the ClickBank
side, and have fully tested and verified your Instant Notification URL.
The integration will fail if these pieces aren't fully done!

===== I do not see my ClickBank customers within Sendlane

If you justÂ completed the integration process, it will take some time
for all of that information to sync over. If you visit the ClickBank
integration page within your Sendlane account and see that the status
still showsÂ  _Initializing_Â orÂ _Syncing_, some information or actions
may not be available yet.Â
