[[respond]]
=== Respond to SMS messages in Gorgias

SMS replies routed to Gorgias will appear like an email in your Gorgias
inbox:

respond to your customer, type your response in the message field and
click Send as usual.

Even though it looks like an email, you're sending an SMS, which means
https://help.sendlane.com/article/462-how-to-send-an-sms-campaign#emoji-character-count[using
emojis] will increase the number of credits used to send your reply.

Images and files are not supported in the Gorgias integration. Images
sent by your customer will not show up in Gorgias or the Sendlane reply
center, and there will be no indication in either that the customer
attempted to send an image. To send an image to your customer via
Gorgias, upload the image to a photo hosting service that provides a URL
for the image.

Don't use hyperlinks when replying to Gorgias tickets; they appear in
brackets to contacts which unnecessarily uses up credits.
https://help.sendlane.com/[This hyperlink] would appear in Gorgias, and
to the contact, as `+This hyperlink [https://help.sendlane.com/]+`
