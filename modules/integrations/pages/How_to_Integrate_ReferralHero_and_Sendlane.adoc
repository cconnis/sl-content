https://referralhero.com[ReferralHero] (formerly Maitre) is a referral
marketing platform that allows you to create referral campaigns,
sweepstakes, raffles, ambassador programs, and pre-launch campaigns.

With ReferralHero and Sendlane, you can easily collect participant
information (and their referrals too!). Then, you can add them to your
lists within Sendlane and trigger automated emails.
