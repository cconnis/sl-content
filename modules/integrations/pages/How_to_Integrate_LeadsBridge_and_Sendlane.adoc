=== Next Steps

Moving forward, if you are looking into integrating Facebook Lead Ads to
Sendlane, through LeadsBridge so data can pass in both directions,
please follow the steps below:

. Navigate to *_Bridges_*
+
image:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5e5e0f612c7d3a7e9ae893c7/file-ni6KNKEdiG.png[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5e5e0f612c7d3a7e9ae893c7/file-ni6KNKEdiG]
. Next, click on the  *_Add
New_* buttonimage:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5e5e0f9104286364bc962160/file-h56eAfC7OG.png[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5e5e0f9104286364bc962160/file-h56eAfC7OG]
. Name your Bridge, browse for ** *_Facebook Lead Ads_* in the _Select
Source_ field and for *_Sendlane_* in the _Select Destination_ one and
the destination we created in the above steps will come up by default
(you can always create a new one if need
be)image:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5e5e103904286364bc962164/file-4LCTJDtMr5.png[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5e5e103904286364bc962164/file-4LCTJDtMr5]
. Next, you will need to choose your _Facebook Ad Account_, your
_Facebook Page_ and __Facebook Form (__if you haven't yet added your
Facebook account to your LeadsBridge dashboard, you can do so by
clicking on the *_Add Ad Account_*
button__)__image:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5e5e10ef2c7d3a7e9ae893d1/file-YdM4l0PVsF.png[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5e5e10ef2c7d3a7e9ae893d1/file-YdM4l0PVsF]__
. On the next step, you will need to simply confirm that you want the
leads to be added to Sendlane, through the custom form. You'll also have
the possibility to choose if you want to be notified via email as soon
as someone subscribes, by toggling the button to _Yes_. When you are
done,
click _*Next*image:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5e5e16ab2c7d3a7e9ae893f2/file-vg3RgaOu9r.png[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5e5e16ab2c7d3a7e9ae893f2/file-vg3RgaOu9r]_
. Here, you will need to match the fields you added inside your Facebook
form and send this info over to Sendlane, like: Name, Email, Form Title,
etc. 
image:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5e5e12c304286364bc96216e/file-vbKTY89fya.png[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5e5e12c304286364bc96216e/file-vbKTY89fya]
. In this final step, you'll be able to send a lead from LeadsBridge to
test if the configuration works properly. To do so, simply fill in
your __Email __and _Full Name_ and then click on _Test Now_. 
+
image:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5e5e148d04286364bc962177/file-1zLfunoH9j.png[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5e5e148d04286364bc962177/file-1zLfunoH9j]
+
. If you did everything right, the button will turn green, meaning your
lead was synced successfully and the integration is ready, so please
make sure to click on _Save & Publish_ at the bottom
+
image:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5e5e14ed2c7d3a7e9ae893e8/file-vnzyfT7UfC.png[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5e5e14ed2c7d3a7e9ae893e8/file-vnzyfT7UfC]

To check if it worked, you can also view the list you selected inside
your Sendlane account and you should see the test information you added.
If it's there, it means your integration is successful and ready to be
used! Congrats, you’re done! 

====== Please Note

For the integration _test_ to be successful, you'll need to make sure
that your Sendlane account is set up with single-opt in access (contact
our https://www.sendlane.com/contact-us[24/7 support team] to set this
up!)
