https://www.moonclerk.com/?via=sendlane[MoonClerk] is a payment platform
designed to facilitate recurring and one-time transactions without
hassle.

Integrating MoonClerk and Sendlane enables you to funnel customer emails
collected at checkout directly to your lists in Sendlane!

'''''

=== Before Getting Started

Prior to connecting with Sendlane, you'll need to have an active
https://www.moonclerk.com/?via=sendlane[MoonClerk account] with a
payment form created!

====== Please Note

All MoonClerk forms have a default email field built in on the second
page for checkout, so you don't have to worry about adding one in.

You should also have your
https://help.sendlane.com/article/71-how-to-find-your-api-key-api-hash-key-and-subdomain[Sendlane
API Key&#44; Hash Key and Subdomain] ready. These can be found in your
Sendlane account under *_Account_* → _*API*._

Last (but not least) be sure you have
https://help.sendlane.com/article/125-creating-a-list[created a list]
inside of your Sendlane account, so MoonClerk knows where to place your
new leads and contacts!
