Welcome, Lurn students!

Connecting your Sendlane account to your Launchpad funnel is quick and
easy. 

'''''

==== Before Getting Started

As mentioned in your Inbox BluePrint course, you do not need to sign up
for a Sendlane account right away. Once you go through the training,
you'll discover the right time to sign up. You'll also need to make sure
that your Sendlane account is set up with single-opt in access (contact
our https://www.sendlane.com/contact-us[24/7 support team] to set this
up!)

For more information about when you should sign up with Sendlane, please
refer to your _Inbox BluePrint Onboarding Guide_ or contact the
https://lurn.com/support[Inbox BluePrint support team].

====== Please Note

Please Note If you are asked to set up “allowed domains” within your
account, that step is no longer necessary and can be ignored!

The autoresponder emails that you select in your Launchpad funnel
will not display within your Sendlane account. You will have to recreate
them within Sendlane.

You can create and add emails to an
https://help.sendlane.com/article/73-automations[automation] within
Sendlane, but be sure to disable/turn off the autoresponder in Launchpad
so that your contacts don't receive duplicate emails.
