=== Next Steps

Now that the integration is completed, the next step is setting up the
actual frequency with which mailfloss will validate and/or remove your
emails. 

You actually have 4 options available to customize your integration:

. *Safe (recommended)*: this means that mailfloss will only remove the
ones they are _absolutely certain_ that are not valid__.__
. *Medium*: this option will allow mailfloss to search for nonexistent
and disposable email addresses, in addition to the above option
. *Aggressive (not recommended)*: basically anything that looks remotely
bad will be removed. This option is not recommended for most users
. *Custom floss:* if none of the above suit your needs and comes with a
couple of options for you to choose from, see below
