=== Test Mode: Testing your funnel before going live

With PayKickstart, you have the ability to test everything before going
live, using the Test Mode feature. To enable that, you will need to
navigate to *_Campaigns_* and select *_Test Mode_* from the
*_Campaign Status_* column:

image:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5e60bb832c7d3a7e9ae8b3da/file-Is3IxJNFR7.png[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5e60bb832c7d3a7e9ae8b3da/file-Is3IxJNFR7]

Now that *_Test Mode_* is enabled, you can run _test transactions_
without having to worry that the payments go through. 

====== Please Note

Once Test Mode is enabled, only the transactions will be considered
_test_ ones. All other integrations attached to the campaign will still
trigger for testing purposes.

After you go through the checkout page submission, you can also check
these  *_Test transactions_* by going to *_Payments → Transactions →
Test:_*
