is a unique email capturing platform that allows you to acquire email
addresses without the need to fill out a form. Instead, Boost requests a
contact's information through social media, capturing their email
address in the process.

Integrating Boost and Sendlane enables you to add collected information
directly to your Lists in Sendlane!
