https://textiful.com/[Textiful] is an easy-to-use data collection tool
that uses the power of text messaging to collect email addresses for new
leads.

Using Textiful and Sendlane, you can collect emails through a keyword
text messaging campaign. These collected email addresses can then be
seamlessly transferred to your Sendlane list of choice. 

Plus, you can also add https://help.sendlane.com/article/82-tags[Tags]
to your new contacts, and employ
https://help.sendlane.com/article/331-custom-fields[Custom Fields] to
populate specific areas of their customer profile.
