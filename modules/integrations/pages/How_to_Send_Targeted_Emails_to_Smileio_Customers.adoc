=== Troubleshooting

*I do not see my Smile.io customers within Sendlane or the Segmentation
options are not available!*

If you have just completed the integration process, it will take some
time for all of that information to sync over. If you visit the Smile.io
integration page within your Sendlane account and see that the status
still shows _Syncing_, some information or actions may not be available
yet. 

If you have any issues using your Smile.io integration,
mailto:mailto:support@sendlane.com[our support team is available 24/7].
Plus, the Smile.io team is just a few clicks away!
