=== Troubleshooting

*I'm not seeing new Contacts in Sendlane from my ClickFunnel form!*

Make sure there is only one ClickFunnel form per page on your website.
Inserting more than one ClickFunnel form on a single page of your
website can cause Contact information to not be passed to your Sendlane
account.

Because this integration is native to ClickFunnels, Sendlane is only
able to provide limited troubleshooting support. However, if you _do_
need help, the ClickFunnels team is just a few clicks away!
