=== Shopify Integration Installation

===== ‚ö†Ô∏è If you are an agency user installing Shopify, you must create a user in the target account to complete the integration process with

Agency users often run into infinite loops when trying to install
Shopify. To avoid this,¬†create a user in the account you want to
integrate with Shopify (use plus addressing to use your own email
address for this new account), then follow the instructions in this
article to complete the Shopify integration, logging into the new user
account when you are redirected from Shopify.

===== ‚ö†Ô∏è Sendlane will import Contacts with ANY Shopify activity in the past 12 months; new and existing customer activity will begin syncing automatically

If you have imported Contacts into Shopify in the past 12 months, those
contacts will be included even if they have not purchased a product or
had any other activity in the past 12 months. Customer activity will
update existing Sendlane Contact records and create new Sendlane Contact
records for new customers.

===== ‚ö†Ô∏è If you are on a free trial, do not integrate with Shopify

Upgrade your free trial to a paid plan before integrating with Shopify
to avoid syncing issues.

Watch the video below to see the process of integrating Shopify and
Sendlane from start to finish:

====== My status is stuck at pending, and I'm getting an error that says, "Are you sure you want to install this integration?"

This error means that your integration's Lists have not been assigned.
To fix the error:

. Click the *Settings* icon
. Select Lists for any of the five categories without an assigned List
. Click *Continue*

image:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/65a5c30ca45534249a235ba5/file-5hkdg4UvDD.gif[file-5hkdg4UvDD.gif]

'''''

====== My status is stuck at pending!

If your Shopify integration status is stuck at Pending, ensure that all
Lists have been assigned in the link:#configure[Shopify integration's
settings].

If all Lists have been assigned, the connection between Sendlane and
Shopify may have been interrupted during the integration process. If
this happens, you'll need to delete the Shopify integration in Sendlane
and the Sendlane app in Shopify. You must delete both in order to be
able to complete the integration process again.

Delete the existing Shopify integration that is stuck at Pending by
clicking the trash can icon:

image:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/64e64b53e114d11769c3c8be/file-lPcKuvVSr4.png[file-lPcKuvVSr4.png]

Delete the Sendlane app in Shopify:

. Click *Settings*
. Click *Apps and sales channels*
. Hover over *Sendlane Marketing Automation*
. Click *Uninstall*
. Click *Uninstall* again

[[1]]
====== I don't see my Shopify customers in my Sendlane account!

If you just completed the integration process, check back later. If you
visit the Shopify integration page within your Sendlane account and see
that the status still shows `+Initializing+`, `+Pending+`, or
`+Syncing+`, some information or actions may not be available.

If you are on a free trial, you are limited in the number of Contacts
that can be synced over. Upgrade to a paid account, then click the
Resync button in the Actions column of your Shopify integration.
