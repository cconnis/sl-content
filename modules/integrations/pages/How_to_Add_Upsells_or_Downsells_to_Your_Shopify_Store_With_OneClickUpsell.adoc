[[automation]]
=== Creating a "Thank you" Automation

After a customer makes a purchase, it's a great idea to follow up and
thank them for their business!

You'll want to configure each one differently if you'd like to utilize
both triggers within your Sendlane account.

. In Sendlane, click start by creating a new
https://help.sendlane.com/article/73-automations[Automation] and choose
S__tart from scratch__
. Click on *_Click here to add trigger_* and select
*_OneClickUpsell_* from the Your integrations dropdown +
 +
image:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/60c90c23b899954cddd47a79/file-uNxpgsmzuA.png[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/60c90c23b899954cddd47a79/file-uNxpgsmzuA]
. Select *_Offer Completed_* and choose your store +
 +
+
====== Please Note

The OneClickUpsell _Offer Completed_ trigger functions the same way as
the Shopify _Order Completed_ trigger, so be sure you don't have
duplicate "Thank you" automations running at the same time!
. Click the "*+*" to add a new *_Send Message_* action
. https://help.sendlane.com/article/150-email-builder[Design your email]
and don't forget to click *_Publish_* on the email message once you're
done
. Finish building out your automation (adding any other actions or
communications you'd like) and *_Activate_* your
funnelimage:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5ee258aa2c7d3a10cba8c537/file-NNSNQ7H5f4.png[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5ee258aa2c7d3a10cba8c537/file-NNSNQ7H5f4]

Now, if a customer purchases one of your upsell items, they'll receive a
thank you email from you!
