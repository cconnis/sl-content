=== Before Getting Started

Prior to connecting with Sendlane, you'll need an

Please also have your

=== Connecting a Wishloop Campaign to a List

Now that your Sendlane integration is in the system, let's go over how
to link a specific Wishloop campaign to a List:

. From within the editor of any of your Wishloop forms, ensure that
there is a field for collecting a user's email
addressimage:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5cfeb9e12c7d3a493e798008/file-7R845wcAUc.png[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5cfeb9e12c7d3a493e798008/file-7R845wcAUc]
. Click on the section with the email field, select *_Settings_* from
the top of the sidebar menu and under _List_, choose your integrated
Lists from the
drop-downimage:https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5cfeb9eb0428632218e3ee2a/file-wIqBjN05QR.png[https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5cd30c272c7d3a177d6e82b7/images/5cfeb9eb0428632218e3ee2a/file-wIqBjN05QR]
. Finish designing your form 

Once you're done, and everything is saved - your integration is now
complete! 

Leads generated with Wishloop will now be automatically funneled into
your selected Lists in Sendlane.
