Member] is a powerful, yet easy to use Wordpress membership software
solution that can turn any WordPress site into a full-blown membership
site.

When a visitor signs up for a membership level, you can seamlessly
transfer their information to any list within Sendlane, apply or remove
tags, and trigger automated emails.

'''''

=== Before Getting Started

Prior to connecting with Sendlane, you'll need to have an active
Wordpress website with the
http://go.wishlistproducts.com/?p=SendlaneAffiliate&w=wlm[latest version
of the WishList plugin installed].

====== Please Note

Be sure you've upgraded to WishList Member 3.0. Versions 2.93 and older
do not include the Sendlane integration.

Also, be sure you have your
https://help.sendlane.com/article/71-how-to-find-your-api-key-api-hash-key-and-subdomain[Sendlane
API Key&#44; Hash Key and Subdomain] ready. These can be found in your
Sendlane account under *_Account_* → _*API*._

Last (but not least) be sure you have

inside of your Sendlane account, and have the
https://help.sendlane.com/article/125-lists#id[list ID] handy, so
WishList Member knows where to place your new leads and contacts!
